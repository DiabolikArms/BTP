Additionally, a 10% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) is deducted from the interest payable if the total interest earned by an individual is equal to or more than Rs. 5,000 in a financial year, the ET report says.\\nHowever, resident individuals can avail exemption from TDS by submitting form 15G / 15H (as applicable), although this declaration must be submitted every financial year until maturity.\\n\\nWhen choosing a corporate FD scheme to invest in, consider the following factors:\\n1. Credit Rating: Select higher-rated corporate FDs based on their credit rating, which indicates the underlying risk of the company.\\n2.

In response, the RBI has issued a directive urging these institutions to correct their practices and ensure fair treatment of borrowers.\\nHere are the four key areas where banks have been found to be overcharging borrowers:\\nIn a notification issued by the RBI on April 29, 2024, the following unfair practices by banks and other financial institutions were identified:\\n- Charging interest from loan sanction date: Some lenders were charging interest from the date the loan was approved or when the loan agreement was signed, instead of from the actual date the money was disbursed to the customer.\\n- Interest charged from cheque date: For loans disbursed by cheque, some banks were charging interest from the date on the cheque, even though the cheque was given to the customer several days later.

Today, our expert Shubham Aggarwal, Director and Chief Mentor at Vidyapeeth IAS Academy, is sharing his insights on UPSC interviews which follow the Mains. Read on for his suggestions on how you can make the best of your UPSC interview, also known as Personality Test.\\n\\nThe UPSC exam is a prolonged process which engages its aspirants for almost two years to finally make it to the list. From 12-hour-a-day preparation regime, to notifications and form submissions, carefully choosing the optional subject, to the Preliminary stage that eliminates almost all the aspirants, to rigorous intermediary Mains answer writing and finally the interviews, it’s a rigorous journey to say the least. UPSC gives you time frames in batches/slots to appear for the Interview Round. Here are some insights from my own interview experience on how you can maximise your interview scores!\\nDAF (Detailed Application Form) requires a careful and intelligent approach. If you are not careful, it may turn out to be a self-inflicted death trap! One needs to be smart in filling this form. UPSC asks you some personal details about your mother tongue, place of birth, your family, education/qualifications, existing job, achievements, awards, leadership roles, interests and hobbies, and other accolades. Apart from your past, it also asks you about your future aspirations regarding service preferences, your zone/state cadre preferences, etc. It means that you would be judged at every stage of your life. One can avoid an awkward situation by giving the TRUEST account of life to the interviewers in DAF. You will be asked personal questions on the basis of your DAF only. Because this is your first face to face personal interaction with UPSC, you ought to have true knowledge about what you told them about yourself!\\nBe careful with interests and hobbies. They are those traits which you like doing in your free time, not for money, but pleasure and you have been doing it regularly, till recently. Let's say cricket is not your hobby if you only played gully cricket in your childhood and have not been in touch. Or, reading may not be your hobby if you read academic books out of compulsion, in order to clear an exam! It would be absurd if you mention a hobby and you cannot answer a question related to it, because you have not experienced it up close and personal.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nM.Tech in Applied AI from VNIT, Nagpur\\nIntellipaat\\nLearn More\\nBe confident. Maintain an upright posture and calm, composed demeanour. Be gentle, yet firm, humble, honest, neat and tidy, simple and sober, ambitious, but not anxious. Have the positive attitude of an ant looking to grab even the last drop of honey! Your ‘Personality Test’ is not about the knowledge you possess, because you have already shown your mettle in the Mains. It is about what type of a person you are. Are you good enough to serve the diverse and vulnerable, underdeveloped people of India? Are you ready to take the challenge or do you still love your comfort zone and wish to sign and move files like a government clerk?\\n\\nShow them your creative instincts. Demonstrate your problem solving ability, the emotional quotient which you will use when you are put in a tough situation. It’s akin to, let's say controlling a violent mob of protestors at Jantar Mantar. Do not hesitate to give an honest, rational, progressive opinion on any matter.\\nBe upfront about what you don’t know. Should you be confused in front of the interviewers? It is better to accept, with courtesy, that you do not know something or have no opinion on the same rather than beating around the bush. You will be appreciated for gracefully saying a NO instead of an unconvincing YES!\\nListen to them carefully. It's an obvious sign of respect. Do take a moment to think, (or even two moments), speak to the point, nod when they say or explain, wear a gentle smile, do not laugh, maintain a healthy eye contact (do not stare) and put up a magnificent show. Do not ignore the ones sitting beside the one who asked you a question. Orient your face towards all eminent men, give them all the due attention required, focusing more on the interviewer who throws his question.\\nBe prepared with Current Affairs. I am assuming that you are well aware of the current events, related themes and the controversial issues related to India and the world. Make crisp one/two line answers for these issues. You can practise speaking in the mirror, record yourself in mobile/camera, seek help from family, friends, fellow aspirants and reach out to me for the same without any hesitation because “good mentors are always there”.

Even as gold prices touch new highs this year, one wonders when the yellow metal will hit levels of Rs 1 lakh, or even Rs 2 lakh? What does historical data on the movement of gold suggest and what should investors do?\\nGold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.\\nThis follows a similar pattern observed in the previous 9-year period, when the price tripled from Rs 8,250 in 2006. Going back further, it took approximately 19 years for the gold price to triple from Rs 2,570 per 10 g in 1987, preceded by tripling cycles of around 8 years and 6 years, states an ET report by Naveen Kumar.\\nIf the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone. Here is what experts have to say on future returns and timeline for gold to hit the Rs 2 lakh level:\\nGold Prices Outlook:\\n\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nM.Tech in Applied AI from VNIT, Nagpur\\nIntellipaat\\nLearn More\\nGold prices are sensitive to global events, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, which can cause rapid increases in relatively short periods. In the past 5 years, factors like rupee weakness, geopolitical issues, the pandemic, and war have contributed to a 75% increase in gold prices, from Rs 40,000 to over Rs 7,00,000, in just 3.3 years. In contrast, from 2014 to 2018, gold prices only increased by 12%, from Rs 28,000 to Rs 31,250.\\n\\nAlso Read | Important updates for NPS subscribers: New charges and security measures announced by PFRDA\\nJateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, states, \"Historical data shows that major global changes, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, can significantly influence gold prices, leading to rapid increases within relatively short periods. The recent past of 5 years has shown rupee weakness as well as geopolitical issues and pandemic and war. All these together have given gold a spurt from Rs 40,000 to Rs 7,00,00+ — a gain of 75% in a matter of 3.3 years. In 2014, gold price was Rs 28,000 and in 2018 it was Rs 31,250, which is only 12% in a matter of 5 years.\"\\nTrivedi also suggests that gold prices could potentially reach Rs 2 lakh within the next 7-12 years, given recent trends.\\nSome experts, like Surendra Mehta, National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, are even more optimistic about gold prices tripling and crossing Rs 2 lakh. Mehta believes that escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel after Ramzan, as well as China-Taiwan tensions, could bring uncertainty and lead to de-dollarisation. He predicts that these factors, along with heavy paper trading of gold in SGE and Comex, could cause gold prices to triple within the next 6 years.\\nHowever, it\\'s important to note that the tripling period for gold prices can vary significantly. Vikram Dhawan, Fund Manager and Head - Commodities at Nippon India Mutual Fund, points out that there has been an instance where the tripling period extended to almost 19 years. Dhawan reminds us that gold, like any other asset, is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns.\\nHe states, \"Like any other asset, gold is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns. However, as long as there is no better alternative, gold will continue to be in great demand from consumers and investors alike, hopefully rising to meet their return expectations.\"\\nAlso Read | New mutual fund KYC rules: Is your KYC validated, verified, registered or on hold? Find out\\nGold is widely regarded as one of the most effective hedges against inflation. According to Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, \"Gold price is directly correlated to inflation. Inflation has been high across geographies and will take time to cool off. As long as inflation remains high, gold prices will continue to get support and see an upward trend in the future.\"\\nThe trajectory of inflation will also play a crucial role in determining the pace at which gold prices increase. Hareesh V, Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services, explains, \"Inflation and gold prices often have a complex relationship. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold relatively steady or even increase during times of inflation.\"\\nIn addition to inflation, various other factors also contribute to the fluctuations in gold prices. Dhawan elaborates, \"When inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases, leading investors to turn to gold as a store of value, thus driving up its price. This relationship is complex and not always direct, as other economic factors can also impact gold prices during periods of high inflation.\"\\nThe availability of gold has remained consistent, and any sudden increase in demand has the potential to drive prices higher in the short term. \"The total supply of gold is limited, which is the one reason the metal is considered a valuable asset. The supply of gold comes from two main sources — mining and recycling. The amount of new gold mined each year is relatively stable. The rest of the demand is usually met by recycling scrap gold,\" says Hareesh.\\nThe growing demand from central banks is expected to persist and may contribute to rising prices. \"There has been large-scale buying from some large central banks as they are considerably increasing their gold holdings — like Russia, China, India, etc. Since the supply of gold is limited, this increase in sovereign treasury holdings will continue to put pressure on supply and will support gold prices. We do not see the supply-side pressure easing in the near future as the risk of geopolitical conflicts does not seem to be easing,\" says Gahlaut.\\nAlso Read | Using a credit card? From usage beyond limit to overlimit fees - top queries answered based on RBI’s new FAQs\\nWhile jewellery has traditionally been a significant driver of demand, it may not continue to play the same role in the future. However, the demand for bullion is anticipated to increase. \"I can see that in a country like India, gold is converting its orbit from consumption item to investment item at a much faster pace. So, sale of jewellery will keep dropping with improved sale of bullion due to financialisation of gold,\" says Mehta.\\nThe shifting dynamics of the global landscape may have a lasting effect on the trajectory of gold prices. Dhawan suggests, \"A decline in the credit rating of the US, whether actual or perceived, may propel gold into a multi-decade bull run. Re-globalisation leading to competitive currency devaluations, along with trade disputes, is conducive for gold prices. On the positive side, bigger and wealthier emerging economies that have a cultural affinity towards gold, like India, may lead to a material increase in gold consumption, underpinning the prices.\"\\nIf the present situations persist or intensify, gold prices are expected to surge even higher. Gahlaut states, \"Any escalation of regional or global conflicts, outright wars breaking out, and dollar domination coming under pressure as a global currency can lead to a spike in gold prices. While returns from gold are not linear, gold will continue to play an important role as a risk reduction tool and as a hedge against inflation.\"\\nThe implementation of ESG regulations could potentially cause a significant decrease in the supply of gold. Dhawan explains, \"The strict adoption of environmental, social & governance (ESG) rules worldwide is a threat to gold production. This is because gold mines are among the most expensive and most toxic places.\"\\nGold prices: What should investors do?\\n\\nWhen considering whether to link your investment strategy to the rapid tripling of gold prices, it\\'s essential to approach the decision with caution. \"In conclusion, the trajectory of gold prices will be shaped by a combination of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, the fundamental role of gold as a safe-haven asset suggests continued potential for growth in the future,\" says Trivedi.\\nIncorporating gold into your investment portfolio can be a wise choice for diversification purposes. \"Diversifying investments and considering different assets, including gold, can help mitigate risks associated with inflation. During deflationary phases, gold tends to perform well compared to most asset classes,\" says Dhawan.\\nAlso Read | Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status\\nHowever, it\\'s crucial not to base your entire gold investment strategy solely on the expectation of its tripling potential. \"While it is impossible to predict how long gold will take to triple from the current level, it is important to note that as an asset class, gold plays a critical role as a hedge against inflation, volatility, geopolitical and currency risks and, therefore, will remain an important part of asset allocation in a person\\'s portfolio,\" says Gahlaut.\\nInvesting in gold can be beneficial at any time when you are aiming to diversify your investment portfolio. Nevertheless, as the price of gold continues to rise, there may be opportunities to purchase gold during dips in the market. \"Higher prices may eventually lead to reactions from the supply side. However, as gold is under-owned and global gold ETF holdings are at a five-year low, pullbacks may bring in dip buying from investors. Moreover, central banks continue to be net buyers,\" says Dhawan.', 'comments': [{'user': 'Ashok Kumar', 'comment_text': \"Gold price has gone up because US put sanctions against Russia and made its $ reserves inoperative.

From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.\\nHowever, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy.\\nHence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management. When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.\\nFinancial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nM.Tech in Applied AI from VNIT, Nagpur\\nIntellipaat\\nLearn More\\nHere are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:\\nStart Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores.\\nMake Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money.\\nTeach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings. This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey.\\nMake Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing.\\nExplore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children.\\nEncourage Smart Shopping: Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.\\nBy instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.\", 'comments': [{'user': 'Uday Dangariya', 'comment_text': \"I believe that this is a excellent reading passage for youth to prevent financial crisis nowadays.It can help them out for their future also.

If share certificates are lost, apply for duplicate shares.\\nIn the event of a deceased shareholder, legal heirs must handle the transmission process, including potential court proceedings based on investment value, as noted by Garg.\\nFollowing the issuance of an entitlement letter by the company, the legal heir must submit a claim via IEPF Form 5 on the MCA portal.

This self-awareness is what differentiates us from animals, and deepening it is fundamental to our personal evolution. The term self-awareness can mean different things to different people. In my experience, there are five distinct levels of self-awareness, each representing a progressively deeper understanding of ourselves.\\nTOP PICKS FOR YOU\\nTransforming Our Reality Through Soul Consciousness\\nBe Like Radha, Transcend The Dance Of Thoughts\\nTough to be The Brahman\\nThis progression can also guide us when we are trying to change any behaviour or habit.\\nThe first level of self-awareness involves recognising our common behaviour patterns and visible personality traits. For example: \"I often get angry.\"\\nIf we wish to change this trait, we need to examine it more closely: how often does it happen, what\\'s the intensity of the anger, how long does it last, what triggers it.\\nMoving inwards, the second level involves being aware of our recurring thoughts and feelings. For example: \"When my teenagers don\\'t listen to my advice, I feel frustrated and worry they will make big mistakes. This makes me angry.\"\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nData Science Course from iHUB, IIT Roorkee.\\nIntellipaat\\nSign Up\\nHere, we are aware not only of the angry behaviour but also of the thoughts and feelings that accompany it. To expand our awareness, it\\'s useful to observe the impact our anger has on others and ourselves. How do the children feel, what are they learning about power dynamics and anger, how do we feel afterwards, was the anger worth it?\\nWe usually recognise our recurring thoughts and feelings when we choose to pause and reflect. But at the third level, we are in tune with our constantly changing thoughts and feelings as they subtly arise within us, whether they are linked with insecurity, envy, greed, love, empathy, or generosity.\\n\\nExample: \"I am aware when thoughts of disapproval or feelings of anxiety and anger arise in me, often accompanied by a tightening sensation in my chest and quicker breathing.\" This kind of self-awareness is crucial for change. Such mindfulness allows us to choose different responses instead of reacting in a conditioned way.\\nBeing in touch with our evolving thoughts and feelings paves the way for the fourth level of self-awareness. We then begin to notice the origins of these thoughts and feelings. And we realise our deep-seated conditioned beliefs.\\nThis self-awareness helps us change our behaviour patterns at the root. Identifying our limiting beliefs allows us to explore and adopt healthier ones.\\nThe final level of self-awareness requires a much deeper dive within. It\\'s the most powerful though. It\\'s about becoming aware of our true Self, beyond personality traits, thoughts, feelings and beliefs.\\nExample: \"I am not my thoughts and feelings. Instead, I am that which is aware of all these thoughts and feelings. The thoughts and feelings change, arise and pass, but I am unchanging and always present. I am complete, whole and enough and not limited to this finite body and mind. I am pure awareness.\"\\nGrasping this can be a paradigm shift in our journey of inner growth. Residing in this awareness brings wholeness, equanimity and deeper peace. In that state, the chances of anger arising diminish substantially.\\nAuthored by: Rajiv Vij\\n\\nUnderstanding the Desire for Material Gains: Krishna\\'s Wisdom From Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4, Verse 12', 'comments': [{'user': 'Sundararaman Srinivasan', 'comment_text': '5 Sanskrit phrases blog .....

The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.\\nWhen the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.\\n\\nFormer Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.\\nBLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.\\nMajority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.\\nIslamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP.

With less than two months remaining until Election Day, Harris gained momentum and held a slight edge over her Republican rival.\\nRecent polls show Harris leading\\nA new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.\\nAmong likely voters, Harris’ lead widened to 52% compared to Trump’s 46%. This result was consistent with polling conducted before the Democratic National Convention, where Harris stood at 49% and Trump at 45%.\\nPollsters noted that while most numbers remained stable since August, Harris gained ground among women, now leading by 13 points (54% to 41%), up from a 6-point lead before the convention. Harris also received higher marks for her campaign, with 56% of Americans rating her performance as excellent or good, compared to 41% for Trump.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nM.Tech in Applied AI from VNIT, Nagpur\\nIntellipaat\\nLearn More\\nHarris surpasses Biden’s performance in key states\\nHarris outperformed Trump in the battleground states, maintaining a slight advantage within the margins of error in nearly every national survey. NBC News reported that Harris fared better against Trump than Biden did before his exit, indicating growing confidence in her leadership.\\nThe concept of a margin of error, as explained by Pew Research, refers to the range within which a survey result is expected to fall relative to the true population value. While Harris' lead was within this range, it underscored the competitive nature of the race.\\n\\nTrump’s strengths and weaknesses\\nDespite Harris’ lead, Trump maintained advantages in areas critical to voters. He outperformed Harris on trust regarding key issues such as the economy and inflation, leading by 8 points in each category. Trump also had a 9-point lead over Harris on handling the US-Mexico border. However, Harris was perceived as more trustworthy on protecting American democracy and Supreme Court appointments.\\nThe latest polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ also showed Harris with a 3.8-point national lead over Trump. The ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted from August 23-27 with 2,496 completed interviews, had a margin of sampling error of 2.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.\\nTrump’s consistent base\\nDespite Harris' gains, Trump remained a formidable opponent, consistently polling at around 47% nationwide. Polls conducted by The Wall Street Journal, EPIC-MRA in Michigan, and Bloomberg/Morning Consult in Georgia and Michigan all placed Trump at this level of support. However, the overall trend showed a reversal in fortunes since Biden's departure, with Harris now holding a narrow edge.\\nSwing state dynamics\\nSwing state polls revealed a complex and evolving landscape. Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls indicated that Harris had overtaken Trump within the margin of error in Georgia (50%), Michigan (49%), Nevada (50%), and Pennsylvania (51%). In Wisconsin, she held a more decisive lead at 53%, while she was tied with Trump in Arizona and North Carolina. This sharply contrasted with Biden’s performance in these states, where he struggled to gain traction.\\nBefore Harris took over the Democratic ticket, Biden trailed Trump, even before the June 27 debate that further damaged his campaign. Harris, on the other hand, was now seen as a more trusted leader and was performing better across the board.\\nAdditional polls from The Wall Street Journal, Quinnipiac, and Suffolk/USA Today also showed Harris in the lead, with percentages ranging from 48% to 49%. Trump remained close behind, polling between 43% and 48% in these surveys.\\nPoll insights and campaign implications\\nThe ABC News/Ipsos poll reflected Harris’ ability to leverage her campaign effectively, despite the race remaining highly competitive. Trump, while maintaining a solid base, faced challenges in closing the gap with Harris, who managed to capitalize on recent Democratic momentum.\\nAs both campaigns intensified their efforts, the upcoming weeks were crucial in determining whether Harris could sustain her lead or if Trump would make a comeback. With the presidential election just around the corner, all eyes were on how these dynamics evolved.\", 'comments': [{'user': 'Guest Login', 'comment_text': 'Again this article is more like a PAID NEWS.\\nGround level TRUMP triumphs.\\nJust like Bengal unless golmaal happens\\nhe is sure to win', 'upvotes': '11', 'downvotes': '8', 'replies': [{'user': 'Sumil', 'reply_to': 'Guest Login', 'comment_text': 'Ab.

With 24 Karat gold prices hovering around Rs 74,000 per gram, it's wise to understand the rules for purchasing gold jewellery.\\nAs per an ET report, the government has made buying gold with cash stricter by bringing the gems and jewellery sector under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\\nThis move, announced on December 28, 2020, requires jewellers to comply with KYC norms, such as requesting PAN or Aadhaar for cash transactions above a specified limit, and reporting large value cash transactions of Rs 10 lakh and above to the government.\\nAdditionally, recent years have seen tightening of rules regarding cash transactions under the Income Tax Act, 1961, including TDS on cash withdrawals exceeding specified limits and restrictions on the maximum amount of cash transaction in a single day between individuals.\\nSo, how much gold can someone purchase with cash without needing to provide PAN or Aadhaar at the time of the transaction?

Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act prohibits cash transactions exceeding Rs 2 lakh in a single day, either from one person or related to one event or occasion. If you buy gold jewellery with cash for more than Rs 2 lakh in a single day, you'll violate the income tax law. In such cases, the receiver of the cash is liable to pay a penalty equal to the amount transacted in cash under Section 271D of the Income Tax Act, states the ET report.\\n\\nET illustrates this with an example: If an individual purchases gold jewellery for Rs 4 lakh in cash, exceeding the Rs 2 lakh limit set by Section 269ST, a penalty applies under Section 271D. This penalty equals the cash transaction amount. In this case, with a cash transaction of Rs 4 lakh, the receiver (the jeweller) would be liable to pay a Rs 4 lakh penalty. Since the penalty falls on the receiver, jewellers are hesitant to engage in cash transactions exceeding Rs 2 lakh.\\nALSO READ | What is a gift deed? Some simple points for easy understanding\\nPAN and Aadhaar requirements for gold purchases\\n\\nAccording to Stuti Galiya, Partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, providing PAN details is compulsory for gold purchases valued at Rs 2 lakh and above under Rule 114B of the Income Tax Rules of 1962. Therefore, whether you buy gold for more than Rs 2 lakh per transaction, regardless of the payment method (cash or electronic), you must furnish PAN details to the jewellers.\\nThe PMLA rules require PAN or Aadhaar for transactions above a certain threshold.\\nGaliya further explains that PAN/Aadhaar is necessary for all transactions over Rs 2 lakh. In practice, jewellers who don't accept cash above this limit from a single person when selling gold jewellery comply with Income Tax Act provisions and aren't affected by the December 2020 PMLA notification, unless they suspect the transaction is suspicious. It's important to note that some companies and jewellers have their own extra procedures for verifying customer identity.\\nMeghna Mishra, partner at Karanjawala & Co., states that under the PMLA rules, individuals can conduct high-value cash transactions if they undergo KYC compliance. For purchases of gold jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh and above, individuals must provide PAN or Aadhaar, even for electronic payments.

Early reports suggest that salmon have already begun their journey upstream. Michael Belchik, senior water policy analyst for the Yurok Tribe, said,“I think we’re going to have some early successes.

This article is essential for understanding the intricacies and your entitlements as a customer.\\nThe objective is to provide comprehensive understanding regarding bank locker agreements, associated charges, pertinent fine print, and rights as customers.\\nBank locker rules: 5 things to know\\n\\nThe primary point to grasp is that individuals can open a locker at any bank, regardless of whether they hold an existing banking account there or not. Even if you have no prior relationship with a bank, you are still eligible to obtain a safe deposit locker. For instance, suppose you maintain your salary account at Bank A, your savings at Bank B, and there's Bank C nearby where you have no affiliations. In such a scenario, you can still approach Bank C. While you'll need to complete the KYC process, you can still secure a bank locker at that specific bank.\\nAnother common issue, which many people encounter, is when banks inform them that no lockers are available. However, following the change in RBI norms in August 2021, banks are now obligated to maintain a record of vacant lockers as well as a waitlist of customers. Therefore, when you apply for a locker at a bank, they are required to acknowledge your application, respond to it, and either allocate you a locker if available according to your preference, or provide you with a waitlist number. This ensures transparency and accountability in the process of locker allocation.\\nThe third aspect to consider is that the bank might request you to open a Fixed Deposit (FD) if you intend to secure a locker. This requirement typically applies to new customers, particularly those who are new to the bank. While this may seem stringent, the underlying rationale is to ensure that the bank has recourse in the event of defaults or neglect of the locker. The bank cannot demand an FD for any arbitrary amount; it must be for a specific sum. According to the regulations, the FD must be funded with an amount equivalent to three years' worth of rent, along with any charges specified by the bank for breaking open the locker if rent has not been paid for three years and there have been no operations conducted on the locker.\\nMany people overlook the importance of nominations when it comes to lockers. However, it is mandatory for banks to provide a nomination facility. It is crucial to have a nominee associated with your locker and comprehend the procedures for selecting, changing, or understanding the rights and powers of the nominee. Additionally, it is essential to understand what actions the nominee must take in the unfortunate event that the locker holder passes away.\\nThe final and crucial point to remember is that whatever items you store in the locker are not insured. The bank cannot offer insurance for the contents of your locker. While the bank does bear some liability, it is limited. The bank’s liability is limited to 100 times the annual locker rent. If your annual locker rent amounts to Rs 5000, you will be safeguarded against losses up to Rs 5 lakhs. This coverage extends to events such as fire, theft, robbery, and building collapse. Therefore, if you store valuable items such as jewelry in the locker, it is advisable to have them professionally appraised and insured separately.\", 'comments': [{'user': 'Manisha Anand', 'comment_text': \"Whatever RBI rules are, its impossible to get a bank locker without a hefty FD. I have experienced myself in Axis Bank. I don't know what they do, but show us the list & then say ,a few lockers will be available after a month as clients are leaving the country.

These rules stop banks and finance companies from charging borrowers extra for missing loan payments or breaking other loan rules. Here’s what the new RBI rules on penal charges mean for borrowers and lenders:\\nNew RBI rules for penal charges, interest\\n\\nAs per the new directives, the RBI has stopped banks and finance companies from charging penal interest, usually imposed on customers for late EMI payments.\\nThey also can't add extra charges to the interest rate. However, banks can still charge penalties. But, they must not add these charges to the loan amount or calculate additional interest on them, states an ET report.\\nThe purpose of imposing penal interest and charges is to encourage responsible credit behavior, not to boost revenue.

Penal charges are a set fee, separate from the interest, while penal interest is an extra rate added onto the customer's existing interest rate. The RBI instructed banks not to include penal charges in the loan amount and not to calculate additional interest on these charges.\\n\\nImplementation timeline\\n\\nThe new guidelines apply to all new loans starting from April 1. Existing loans will be subject to the norms starting from June 1, 2024. The RBI postponed the implementation date from January 1 to April 1 to give financial institutions more time to adjust. Both retail and corporate borrowers will face identical penalties for the same loan product.\\nALSO READ | Can you change the credit card billing cycle and due date more than once?

While penal charges should be reasonable, the RBI has not specified a maximum limit for these charges.\\nApplicability to other loan products\\n\\nThe updated guidelines cover securitization and co-lending portfolios but exclude rupee/foreign currency export credit and other foreign currency loans.

The body is considered akin to clothing that the eternal soul dons and discards. Just as a person discards old garments and wears new ones, the soul passes from one body to another in the cycle of rebirth.\\nThe soul, being immortal, remains unaffected by the physical manifestations of life, such as birth, growth, decay, and death.

In this sense, death can guide individuals on a path towards personal growth and fulfillment.\\n\\nHowever, this perspective on death as a path to perfection or enlightenment isn't universally accepted. Many belief systems emphasize the sanctity of life, the importance of compassion, and the pursuit of spiritual growth through living consciously rather than focusing on death as the means to an end.\\nIt's essential to approach this concept with cultural sensitivity and recognize that beliefs surrounding death and spiritual evolution vary widely among different traditions and individuals.

The first important point to note is that filing ITR is very different from paying income tax. Filing an income tax return (ITR) is compulsory if your gross taxable income surpasses the basic exemption limit or if you have carried out specific transactions.\\nHowever, this does not always imply that you are required to pay income tax.\\nThe deadline for filing ITR for the current assessment year is July 31, 2024, for individuals who are not required to undergo an income tax audit for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Apart from income, there are additional factors that make filing ITR mandatory.\\nUnder section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, you are eligible for a tax rebate if your net taxable income is within Rs 5 lakh (old tax regime) or Rs 7 lakh (new tax regime).\\nThe maximum tax rebate available is Rs 12,500 under the old tax regime and Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime. As a result, if your income falls within the specified levels, you are not obligated to pay any income tax. Nevertheless, even if your tax liability becomes zero due to the tax rebate, filing an ITR is still necessary, according to an ET report.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nExecutive Supply Chain Management Program- Learn from IIT Faculty\\nIntellipaat\\nSign Up\\n\"Generally, taxpayers have a mis-understanding that if tax is not payable then filing of ITR is also not mandatory,\" says Sudhir Kaushik, Co-founder and CEO, Taxspanner.com was quoted as saying.\\nAccording to Kaushik, filing ITR is obligatory if your gross total income, before deductions under Chapter VI (Sections 80C, 80D, etc.), is more than the basic exemption limit.\\nAlso Check | ITR e-Filing FY 2023-24: Which Is The Correct Income Tax Return Form For You? From ITR-1 To ITR-7 - Check Here\\nFor FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), the basic exemption limits under the old tax regime are:\\n\\n* Rs 2.5 lakh for individuals below 60 years of age\\n* Rs 3.0 lakh for individuals above 60 years but below 80 years of age\\n* Rs 5.0 lakh for individuals above 80 years of age\\nUnder the new tax regime, the basic exemption limit for all categories of taxpayers is Rs 3 lakh for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25).\\nWhen is ITR filing mandatory irrespective of income level?\\n\\nAccording to Neeraj Agarwala, Partner at Nangia Andersen India, there are certain situations where individuals must file an ITR regardless of their gross total income:\\n* If an individual\\'s annual bank deposits in one or more savings accounts surpass Rs 50 lakh, they are obligated to file an ITR.\\n* Individuals whose electricity bill exceeds Rs 1 lakh during the year must file an ITR.\\n* Those who own assets in a foreign country, are beneficiaries of such assets, or have signing authority in any overseas account must file an ITR.\\n* Professionals earning more than Rs 10 lakh during a financial year are required to file an ITR.\\n* If a person\\'s TDS/TCS is more than Rs 25,000 (or Rs 50,000 for senior citizens), filing an ITR is compulsory.\\n* Individuals who spend Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel for themselves or others during the financial year are required to file an ITR.\\nAlso Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: Why is Form 16 important for salaried individuals when filing income tax return?\\nTo better understand these requirements, consider the following examples:\\n* Example 1: Consider a salaried individual with a gross taxable income of Rs 5.5 lakh, eligible for a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, 80C deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, and other deductions totaling Rs 1,10,000, you need to file ITR.\\n* Example 2: If your net taxable income is Rs 4.25 lakh, which is below the Rs 5 lakh or Rs 7 lakh threshold (depending on the tax regime), you are exempt from paying income tax due to the rebate under section 87A. However, you must still file an ITR because your gross total income exceeds Rs 2.5 lakh (old tax regime) or Rs 3 lakh (new tax regime).\\n* Example 3: As a salaried individual with a gross taxable income of Rs 7.5 lakh and a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, you may not owe any income tax after deductions and rebates. Nevertheless, filing an ITR is still mandatory.\\nAgarwala states, \"Individuals are mandatorily required to file an income tax return if their total income, excluding deductions under Chapter VI-A, exceeds the basic exemption limit. In this case, the total income excluding gross deductions under section 80C will be Rs 3,90,000 (Rs 5.5 lakh-Rs 50,000-Rs 1.1 lakh) (assuming the other deductions are not under Chapter VI-A), and they will be mandatorily required to file their ITR.\"\\nAlso Read | Form 26 AS: Filing Income Tax Return? Know why Form 26AS is important & how to download it\\nWhat are the consequences of not filing ITR, even if you are mandated to?\\n\\nIf you are obligated to file an ITR but fail to do so by the deadline of July 31, 2024, you have the option to file a belated ITR. However, if you choose not to file at all, you may face several consequences, says Agarwala.\\nFirstly, under Section 234A, if you don\\'t pay your taxes on time, you will be subject to penal interest at a rate of 1% per month on the outstanding tax amount. Additionally, if there is a delay in the payment of advance tax, interest will be levied under Section 234B.\\nMoreover, according to Section 234F, failing to file your ITR within the due date will result in a late fee of Rs 5,000. However, if your annual income is below Rs 5 lakhs, the late fee will be limited to Rs 1,000. If your gross income falls below the basic exemption limit, no penalty will be charged.\\nIt\\'s important to note that when filing a belated ITR, you forfeit the ability to carry forward losses from stocks, future and options (F&O), and other sources. However, you can still carry forward losses from house property.\\nFurthermore, filing an ITR is a prerequisite for receiving any tax refund. If you file a belated ITR, you will not be entitled to any interest on the tax refund.\\nIn the event that you don\\'t file an ITR, the income tax assessing officer has the authority to conduct a Best Judgment Assessment. This means that the tax officer may estimate your income and tax liability based on the information available to them.\\nLastly, if you fail to file your ITR and do not opt for the old tax regime by submitting Form 10-IEA, your income tax will be calculated under the new tax regime by default. As a result, you may miss out on claiming gross deductions that would have been applicable to you.', 'comments': [{'user': 'Prabhakar', 'comment_text': 'When form 16 and 26AS and hence AiS are available only in middle of June.

This sense of security comes from becoming spiritual.\\nSpirituality is concerned with matters of spirit. When we think deeply and for a long time about anything whether it is an idea or an object then the brain has a tendency of focusing on it like a laser and in that process the object vanishes from the vision field and only its germ or the spirit remains. It is this deep thinking on anything which makes us spiritual; reduces our greed; provides internal security and gives us a sense of peace and happiness.\\n\\nThis helps us focus on bigger and better things, reduces anxiety and stress levels and creates positive outlook towards life.\\n\\nCreating better environment is what I call nation building. It is the enabling environment which makes us feel happy to live in, work in and just be a part of it. This environmental happiness also gives us a sense of belonging, makes us feel proud of our surroundings and gives us a sense of ownership.\\nIf we create a happy and pleasant environment for our work and living, then we will make India a great place to live. Each one of us should therefore work towards improving our immediate environment so that it becomes nice and cheerful. Then we will be genuinely proud to be a part of it which is the India of my dreams.\\nIndia is endowed with plenty of land, good weather, intelligent and hardworking people. What is lacking is leadership to guide and inspire the citizens to work for higher cause. This is what Mahatma Gandhi did during his war for independence. Working for independence based upon the noble path of non-violence was the cause which united Indians to work selflessly.\\nEach one of us therefore have a duty to educate children and young students regarding ethics, sustainability, and spirituality.\\nThus I feel that when all of us work for higher cause of creating happiness and well-being rather than dividing the country by fear then we will unleash the creative force of Indians and help make India a great and pleasant country to live and work in.

Krishn says, 4.11, \"Ye yatha mam prapadyante, tan tathaiva bhajami aham,\" which means, \"By whatsoever way men seek me, I accept them the same way.\" Thus, there is one God, who appears to us in the form that we seek Him. It applies to all human beings in any part of this universe. In the Gita, He appears in both ways - nirakar, formless and sakar, with form.\\nTOP PICKS FOR YOU\\nSacred Ties That Awaken\\nHow Can I Be a Better Version of Myself?\\nChoosing To Forgive Is An Act Of Self-Liberation\\nThe Ishwar who created this vast creation, can also assume a form, simultaneously at many places. He can express himself in many forms and in many numbers. The raas lila of Krishn is an example of this. While dancing with gopis, he is with every one of them at the same time.\\nKrishn says in the Gita, \"All beings are equal to me.\" \"I am the same to all beings. There is none whom I hate nor is anyone dear to me. However, those who worship me, in devotion, abide in me and I also remain in them.\"\\nAll deities are forms of that one God. The devotees who worship different deities for some material gain or for curing their suffering are also his worshippers. Krishn says there are four types of his devotees. The first is \\'arta\\', a devotee who worships for the sake of removal of suffering. The second, called artharthi, worships for acquiring material possessions. A seeker of knowledge is the third kind, called jijnasu. The last one is a man of wisdom, who identifies with him with exclusive devotion.\\nThe rewards made available to such devotees by the other gods and goddesses are bestowed by the Supreme Being only, ultimately. So, the different forms of different deities are also manifestations of the One, absolute, omnipotent, all-pervading God.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nAdvanced Certificate Program in Electric Vehicle Design\\nIntellipaat\\nSign Up\\nShri Krishn emphasises his supremacy, \"Mattah parataram nanyat kinchid-asti dhananjaya; mayi sarvamidam protam, sootre manigana iva.\" The verse implies, \"There is nothing higher than me, O Arjun. All glorious beings and things are woven in me; just as precious stones are strung upon a single thread.\" Here too one God, the string, holds together numerous divine manifestations, precious stones.\\nAt several places in the Gita, Krishn declares that God resides in the hearts of all. That is yet another pointer to one God pervading the entire universe. The vishwa-rupa, cosmic form that Krishn shows, as described in the 11th chapter of the Gita, is another splendid display of all divine expressions being included in the one God. The one appears as many.\\n\\nThe 10th chapter, vibhooti yoga, of the Gita talks of God being the basis of everything in the entire universe that shines with extraordinary charm and power. \"Please understand,\" says Krishn, 10.41, \"That anything or anybody in this vast universe, endowed with the most impressive qualities or glory, has arisen from a part of my effulgence.\"\\nThus, there are numerous pointers in the Gita to the overarching truth that God is one, and his expressions are many.\\nAuthored by: Bansi Mahajan\\n\\nYour Ticket Out of Karma: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4, Verse 11', 'comments': [{'user': 'Sundararaman Srinivasan', 'comment_text': 'Tulsi Divine Graceful leave.....is exempt from Nirmalya pushp .....it can be reused for Archana worship if needed ....Om Namasivaya 🕉', 'upvotes': '0', 'downvotes': '0', 'replies': []}, {'user': 'Sundararaman Srinivasan', 'comment_text': 'Tulsi herbal benefits blog in Health section was interesting......it deals with Health benefits of the body mind pack ......Soul spirit is blessed directly by offering a single Tulsi leaf to Lord Shriman Narayana Krishna....

Many investors unknowingly invest in multiple equity schemes without realizing that their portfolios may have significant overlaps, which defeats the purpose of diversification. While it's challenging to completely eliminate overlaps, there are strategies to reduce their occurrence and achieve diversification goals.\\nAn equity mutual fund scheme allocates its investments across a range of stocks according to regulatory directives.\\nFor instance, a large-cap fund must allocate a minimum of 80% of its portfolio to stocks ranked 1-100 by market capitalization, while a mid-cap fund is required to invest at least 65% in stocks ranked 101-250 by market capitalization.\\nSome investors might spread their investments across two or three large-cap funds from different fund houses, believing they are diversifying their portfolios. However, in reality, a significant portion of their investments may overlap, with many funds holding similar sets of underlying stocks such as large banks, IT companies, and diversified conglomerates. This phenomenon is known as portfolio overlap.\\nIn equity mutual funds, portfolio overlap refers to the situation where different funds hold the same stocks, leading to a concentration of investments. For instance, investing in multiple large-cap funds from different companies may result in a significant portion of the funds being allocated to the same set of stocks like large banks and IT companies, creating portfolio overlap.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nExecutive Supply Chain Management Program- Learn from IIT Faculty\\nIntellipaat\\nSign Up\\nPortfolio overlap in mutual funds occurs due to regulatory guidelines set by Sebi, which dictate where funds can invest based on market capitalization rankings. This limitation in investment options often leads to overlaps between funds. Moreover, portfolio overlap can also happen if investors choose funds from the same asset management company, as each AMC has a unique approach to building portfolios.\\nTo mitigate portfolio overlap, investors should aim to diversify their investments across various fund categories. By spreading investments across different categories such as large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and sectoral funds, the likelihood of overlap decreases as the stock universe expands. Another effective strategy to reduce portfolio overlap is to invest in funds managed by different AMCs, as each AMC follows a distinct investment style.\\nThis approach not only helps in minimizing overlap but also enhances portfolio diversification. Overall, while complete elimination of portfolio overlap may not be feasible, investors can take proactive steps to manage and reduce it to achieve better diversification outcomes.\", 'comments': [{'user': 'jags', 'comment_text': 'well yes Michael Jackson went from black to white and now DOVE from Unilever wants to make money from ugly people', 'upvotes': '1', 'downvotes': '0', 'replies': []}, {'user': 'Sudhir', 'comment_text': 'No , Kamala has gone from Indian to Black.

Flexi cap funds are categorized as open-ended, dynamic equity mutual fund schemes, allowing fund managers the liberty to invest across companies of all market capitalizations without limitations.\\nUnlike other fund categories that have fixed allocation requirements, flexi cap funds mandate a minimum of 65% investment in equity and equity-related instruments. Financial advisors advocate for flexi cap funds due to the freedom they provide to fund managers in company allocation, in contrast to the restricted mandates of large cap, mid cap, small cap, and multi cap funds.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nSet The Standard\\nCFA Institute\\nSchemes focusing on large cap, mid cap, small cap, and multi cap have predetermined mandates, compelling them to adhere to specific categories of companies within their portfolio.\\nFor instance, a large cap fund is mandated to invest a minimum of 80% in companies ranked 1 to 100 by market capitalization, while a mid-cap fund must allocate at least 65% of its portfolio to companies ranked 101-250 by market capitalization.

This verification step is important to ensure that all details are accurate before the request is approved.\\nHowever, the PFRDA stated that users must follow the instructions of the CRA system without deviation when processing exit, withdrawal, or claim requests.

Originally launched as a 110 cc model, the lineup expanded with a 125 cc version, leading to a cumulative sales figure of over 65 lakh units. In 2021 alone, the Jupiter brand accounted for a whopping 86 percent of TVS's scooter sales.\\nDespite its success, Jupiter hadn't seen a major generational update—until now.\\nEnter the 2024 TVS Jupiter - in its fresh skin and bones almost after 11 years of launch. We had the chance to take it for a spin at TVS’s testing track in Hosur, covering just over 20 kilometres. Although the near-perfect track conditions didn't fully replicate real-world scenarios, we got a solid first impression of how this latest iteration is likely to perform on the streets.\\n2024 TVS Jupiter: Design\\n\\n\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nGet AI PCs for business\\nIntel\\nThe 2024 TVS Jupiter has had a serious glow-up in the design department. At first glance, it’s clear that this isn’t just the same old scooter with a few tweaks; it’s taken a leap towards a sportier and more youthful vibe. Up front, you’ve got a sleek LED DRL with integrated turn indicators, giving it a major upgrade over its predecessors.\\n\\nBesides that, the sides now feature dynamic lines that make it look lively and full of energy - unlike the flat, basic profile of the previous model. At the rear, there’s a sleek LED light bar with integrated turn signals and emergency braking lights. With these fresh design elements, it would be safe to say that the new Jupiter isn’t just keeping up with the evolving family scooter market—it’s standing out in a big way. In our opinion, the 2024 Jupiter is one of the most handsome family scooters in India presently.\\n\\nPorsche 718 Cayman GT4RS Review: Inspires you to be Healthy! | TOI Auto\\n\\n2024 TVS Jupiter: Features\\n\\nBesides the cosmetic upgrades, the company has now also equipped the new Jupiter with modern tech. Starting from the front, the LED headlamp now gets a follow-me function borrowed from its bigger sibling. The instrument cluster, on the other hand, is now a neat, digital unit with a host of indicators including speedometer, trip meter, time, fuel, economy and more if connected to the SmartXConnect app. Unfortunately, we couldn't put the connectivity features to the test during our quick spin. However, the instrument cluster deserves a shout-out. It’s well-lit and everything’s laid out in a way that’s easy on the eyes. The graphics are clean and the info is neatly separated, so you can grab what you need at a glance without losing focus on the road.\\n\\nBesides these, you also get a USB charger, a roomy glove box, a 33-litre storage space under the seat - courtesy of the fuel tank that has now been integrated under the floorboard. It also gets a long, flat seat that the company says is the biggest in its class. When you add all of this together, what you get is a feature-packed, practical family scooter without having to burn a hole in your pockets.\\n\\nTVS Jupiter 2024 - Riding comfort, ergonomics and performance\\n\\nNow, coming to the ride quality bit, the Jupiter has always been an agile, easy-to-maneuver scooter and the 2024 iteration of the model is no different. In fact, it’s better. Before we talk about the ride quality, here is what it offers on papers. It is powered by a new, refined 113.3 cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that’s rated for 7.91 hp and 9.2 Nm of torque. However, with the newly-introduced iGo assist, the peak torque output can reach up to 9.8 Nm. The iGo assist not only saves fuel by shutting off the engine when you’re stopped for a bit, like at red lights; but also kicks in with extra torque when you give it full throttle, which is awesome for zipping past traffic. That said, it won’t make you feel like a superhero but yes, you will experience a noticeable zip!\\n\\nWhen it comes to ergonomics and comfort, the new Jupiter continues to deliver. The riding posture is nicely upright, and the seat is designed for a relaxed position with great support for your thighs. You’ll stay comfortable on long city rides, with no strain on your shoulders or lower back.\\n\\nNow, onto the ride — the new Jupiter really impresses here. It’s quick off the line and offers smooth, linear acceleration up to 53-55 kmph. We didn’t notice much vibration until we hit 73 kmph; beyond that, there’s a bit of buzz, but it’s mostly confined to the bottom of the scooter. That said, this scooter, like it has always been, will be comfortable to cruise in the city at speeds up to 75 kmph without breaking a sweat. Moreover, it is impressively agile and nimble, and will be comfortable to make those quick maneuvers or escapes in panic situations. The suspension setup, with a telescopic fork up front and a preload-adjustable rear spring, keeps things stable and balanced, thus making the turns a lot more fun.\\n\\nBraking duties in the new TVS Jupiter are handled by a 220 mm front disc, 130 mm rear drum setup on the higher-end variants. The sync brake system (SBS), as TVS calls it, delivers a confident braking experience. Even when you apply a single brake, the system even distributes the braking force to both wheels leading to a stable stop. In fact, it now also has an emergency braking light at the tail section which alerts the following vehicles in cases of panic braking situations.\\nTVS Jupiter 2024: Verdict\\n\\n\\nOverall, the updated Jupiter is a well-rounded package with its fresh styling, new features, and a host of updates here and there. It’s practical, user-friendly, and priced from Rs 73,700, ex-showroom. The model is available in four variants and seven colour options. If you’re after a scooter that looks great and covers all the essentials, this one should definitely be on your radar.\", 'comments': [{'user': 'mdl', 'comment_text': 'Step down Modi.

The bonds are held in the RBI's records or in demat form, mitigating the risk of scrip loss and other related issues.\\nInvestors can purchase Sovereign Gold Bonds from the primary market during the government-announced subscription periods or from the secondary market through the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).\\n\\nAccording to an ET report, if you fail to apply for SGBs during the primary issuance, you can still invest in them through the stock exchanges in the secondary market.

In both cases, capital gains will be taxable according to the usual definition of short-term and long-term capital gains. If it is the former, the rate applicable will be at its peak. If it is the latter, then the investor can choose between a flat tax rate of 10% or 20% after considering indexation.\\nThe NSE website provides important information about Sovereign Gold Bonds through frequently asked questions section. SGBs can be traded on stock exchanges from a date notified by the RBI, but only bonds held in de-mat form with depositories are eligible for trading.

Bids can be cancelled until the last date of the issue period.\\nAlthough the term of an SGB is eight years, some investors who purchased SGBs earlier may not be able to hold the bonds for the entire tenure.

However, investing a smaller sum means it will require more time to reach your target.\\n\\nConsider this scenario: if you invest Rs 4,000 per month in an equity mutual fund scheme with an annual return of 12%, it will take you slightly over 28 years (339 months) to accumulate Rs 1 crore, assuming you invest consistently without any interruptions, says the ET analysis.\\nBy increasing your monthly investment to Rs 5,000, you can reduce the time needed to save Rs 1 crore to just over 26 years (317 months) at the same 12% interest rate.\\nIf you can allocate 30% of your salary, which amounts to Rs 7,500 per month, you can achieve your Rs 1 crore goal in 23 years or 276 months, assuming the same annual interest rate.\\nFurthermore, if you can invest Rs 10,000 every month, which is 40% of your monthly salary, you can reach Rs 1 crore in slightly more than 20 years or 248 months.\\nThese examples demonstrate that the more you can invest each month, the quicker you can attain your financial goal of saving Rs 1 crore.\\n\\nSIP mutual fund at 12% return every year\\nSIP amount every month\\nAnnual increase (%)\\nNumber of months it will take to save Rs 1 crore\\nRs 4,000\\nNo increase\\n339\\nRs 4,000\\n5\\n301\\nRs 4,000\\n10\\n264\\nRs 5,000\\nNo increase\\n317\\nRs 5,000\\n5\\n281\\nRs 5,000\\n10\\n246\\nRs 7,500\\nNo increase\\n276\\nRs 7,500\\n5\\n244\\nRs 7,500\\n10\\n215\\nRs 10,000\\nNo increase\\n248\\nRs 10,000\\n5\\n220\\nRs 10,000\\n10\\n194\\nBased on this calculation, you will achieve your goal of becoming a crorepati in just under 22 years (264 months) if you increase your SIP installment by 10% annually.\\nStep-up SIP strategy:\\n\\nAccumulating Rs 1 crore can be achieved more quickly by employing a step-up SIP strategy, which involves increasing your monthly SIP installment annually as your salary rises. This approach not only helps combat the negative impact of inflation on your savings but also enables you to align your savings with your income growth.\\nBy starting with a monthly SIP investment of Rs 4,000 and increasing it by just 5% each year, you can reach your goal of Rs 1 crore in approximately 25 years (301 months). The step-up SIP works by gradually raising your investment amount.\\nFor example, if you begin with Rs 4,000 per month, after a year, you would increase it to Rs 4,200 per month for the entire second year. In the third year, you would invest Rs 4,410 every month, and so on.\\nAlso Read | When will gold prices hit the Rs 2 lakh mark?\\nThe time required to accumulate Rs 1 crore decreases as you increase your initial SIP amount. If you start with Rs 5,000 per month and raise it by 5% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 23 years (281 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% each year, you can become a crorepati in 20.5 years (246 months).\\nSimilarly, starting with a monthly SIP of Rs 7,500 and increasing it by 5% annually, you can save Rs 1 crore in 20.3 years (244 months). A 10% annual increase would allow you to reach your goal in just under 18 years (215 months).\\nIf you begin your SIP investment with Rs 10,000 per month and raise it by 5% each year, you can accumulate Rs 1 crore in 18.3 years (220 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 16 years (194 months).\\nRemember, even if you can't invest a substantial sum initially, don't worry. Increase your SIP amount only if your salary increases. Consistency and gradual increments can help you reach your financial goals.\\nSIPs are generally ideal for long-term investments due to the principle of compounding. When investing in a mutual fund SIP, it's important to commit for the long term. Maintaining patience and consistently investing over the years is key. If you can continue your SIP without interruptions, cancellations, or withdrawals during market downturns, you are more likely to achieve your financial goals.\", 'comments': [{'user': 'Vijay Desikan', 'comment_text': 'OK, so you save 1 crores in 30 years.

A new era of exploring, understanding and demystifying the subatomic realm was being ushered in.\\nThe laws and principles governing the subatomic world were mired in abstractions, contradictions, and were radically different from the far more predictable domains of classical physics.\\n\\nScience became much more aware of its limitations. Concepts like superposition, entanglement that initially were restricted to thought experiments were now being verified and even applied commercially.\\nQuantum computing is one such domain that uses these abstruse characteristics and fundamentals to revolutionise computing. It is now the next big leap that will redefine and reshape the information and technology sector. Conventional computing depends on all data being encoded to a binary code. All data was reduced to variable combinations of 1 and 0. The value of one bit could either be 1 or 0.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nGet AI PCs for business\\nIntel\\nEach bit in a byte is assigned a specific value, which is referred to as the place value. Eight bits constitute a byte. A byte's place values are used to determine the meaning of the byte as a whole, based on the individual bits. In other words, the byte values indicate what character is associated with that byte.\\nWhat if the bit could simultaneously be 0 and 1? Values lingering in the grey zones of yes and no? A superposition of both possibilities. Welcome to the world of quantum computing.\\n\\nQuantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which process information very differently. While classical bits always represent either one or zero, a qubit can be in a superposition of one and zero simultaneously until its state is measured. In addition, the states of multiple qubits can be entangled, meaning that they are linked quantum mechanically to each other. Superposition and entanglement give quantum computers capabilities unknown to classical computing.\\nQubits can be made by manipulating atoms, electrically charged atoms called ions, or electrons, or by nanoengineering so-called artificial atoms.\\nQuantum computers have shown that they can process certain tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. The qualified, time-tested binary system or Dwaitawad used by classical computers is being rendered obsolete by a far more abstract, mystical pleomorphism. The quantum state doesn't negate duality. It rather transcends duality to a state that defies any numerical nomenclature. It could best be termed as a nondual state that is not restricted to but includes duality. A state that has perhaps been the backbone of Indian philosophical systems. Advaita is much more than the mere affirmation of nonduality. It is a state that is all inclusive and omniscient. A quantum superposition that encompasses existence and non-existence and a simultaneity of both states.\\nThe 'either-or' logical binary thought process being replaced by an all-inclusive experiential non-numeric 'And'. A state that alludes to the canvas on which black and white appear as apparitions.

As a result, it is unlikely that home loan rates will decrease in the near future. Due to the series of repo rate increases that occurred between May 2022 and March 2023, home loan EMIs have increased significantly, and loan tenures have been prolonged by several years.\\n\\nIf you are considering purchasing a home with a loan, here are five important factors to consider.\\n1. Shorter Loan Tenure: According to an ET report, experts recommend that borrowers keep their loan tenure as short as possible to minimize the interest burden. The longer the loan tenure, the higher the interest outgo due to the compounding effect. For example, a Rs 50 lakh loan at 9% interest for 10 years will result in a total interest payment of Rs 26 lakh. Extending the tenure to 15 years increases the interest outgo to Rs 41 lakh, and a 20-year loan will result in an interest outgo of Rs 58 lakh.\\n2. Importance of increasing EMIs: A shorter loan tenure can be challenging for young homebuyers, as the higher EMIs may not fit into their budget. If you must opt for a longer tenure of 15-20 years, try to increase the EMI amount gradually as your income rises. Increasing the EMI by 5% every year can reduce the tenure of a 20-year loan by nearly eight years. If you can manage to increase the EMI by 10% annually, then a Rs 50 lakh home loan with 9% interest rate will be paid off in just 10 years.\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nGet AI PCs for business\\nIntel\\nHow To Reduce Your Home Loan Tenure\\n\\n\\nIf you take a loan of Rs 50 lakh at 9% for 20 years, the EMI will be Rs 44,986\\n\\n\\nIf EMI is…\\n\\nLoan will end in…\\n\\nKept Constant\\n\\n20 years\\n\\nIncreased By 5% Every Year\\n\\n12 years 1 month\\n\\nIncreased y 10% Every Year\\n\\n9 years 5 months\\n\\nPrepayment becomes easier when you anticipate your income to grow each year. It is crucial to remember that prepayment has a more significant impact when the loan is new, so try to increase the EMI as early as possible. Any extra cash, such as proceeds from a maturing investment, a gift, or an annual bonus, should also be used to prepay the loan.\\nAlso Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained\\n3. Insurance: When considering a home loan, it's crucial to evaluate the insurance options offered by the lender. While it's wise to secure life insurance alongside a substantial loan to protect your dependents from unpaid debt, the policies sold by banks may have limitations. These policies are often linked to the loan and may not be transferable, meaning they will terminate if you switch lenders during the loan tenure. Therefore, it is advisable to buy separate term insurance, as the coverage will continue even if you prepay the loan or change your lender.\\n\\n4. Link between loan rate and benchmark: Understanding the connection between the benchmark and loan rate is essential when selecting a home loan. Most home loans have floating rates tied to an external benchmark, such as the RBI repo rate, which has remained at 6.5% since June 2023. Lenders determine the reset period, which can be quarterly, half-yearly, or annually. Determine the frequency of the rate reset before taking a loan. Choose a loan that quickly reflects changes in the external benchmark rate.\\nAlso Check | Post Office Savings Schemes Calculator: SSY, KVP, NSC, MIS, PPF, SCSS - How Much Will You Earn? Be A Crorepati With This Tax-Free Option - Top Points\\n5. Joint loans: If you have a working spouse, consider taking a joint home loan to maximize tax benefits. The government allows a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh on the interest paid on a home loan. However, with rising home prices, the average loan amount has increased significantly in recent years. At a 9% interest rate, a Rs 50 lakh home loan for 20 years would result in an annual interest of approximately Rs 4.5 lakh.\\nIf your spouse earns as well, you can jointly claim up to Rs 4 lakh in deductions if both husband and wife take a joint home loan and each claims a Rs 2 lakh deduction individually. Additionally, some states offer lower stamp duty rates if the property is registered in a woman's name.

However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:\\nWhat is gold, silver hallmarking?\\n\\nHallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.\\nIt serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.\\nHallmarking charges\\n\\n  BY TABOOLA\\nSPONSORED LINKS\\nYOU MAY LIKE\\nGet AI PCs for business\\nIntel\\nHallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.\\nALSO READ | Silver set to outperform gold? Precious metal likely to cross Rs 1 lakh mark over 1 year horizon\\nA consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.\\n\\nTesting for purity\\n\\nAnyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.\\nThe importance of hallmarking\\n\\nThe primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification (HUID) number.\\nOld hallmarking signs\\n\\nIf you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.\\nALSO READ | What is 24 karat gold? Know difference between 999 vs 995 fineness gold\\nHallmark symbols\\n\\nHowever, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.\\nHUID in the hallmarked gold jewellery\\n\\nThe HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.\\nKey components of hallmark on gold jewellery\\n\\nSince the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.\", 'comments': [{'user': 'jags', 'comment_text': 'well yes Michael Jackson went from black to white and now DOVE from Unilever wants to make money from ugly people', 'upvotes': '1', 'downvotes': '0', 'replies': []}, {'user': 'Sudhir', 'comment_text': 'No , Kamala has gone from Indian to Black.

According to a joint survey by the job portal Indeed and the Forrester Consulting Group, more than 75 per cent of employees experience low levels of well-being. Added to this stress is the fear that they will be worse off than their parents at the time of retirement.\\n\\nFinancial literacy empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions, build a secure future, and reduce stress. But we learn this very late in life and surprisingly, there is no place for it in the formal education system. By the time employees realise its importance, they are late. This in turn affects their financial decision making and they end up in a worse financial situation. Studies reveal a strong correlation between financial challenges and decreased workforce productivity which ultimately affects the overall productivity of the organisation.\\nAlthough employees have individual responsibility, over 67 per cent of employees hold their employers responsible for the creation and maintenance of a safe and happy workplace. Therefore, employers can truly impact their employees' financial well-being by actively promoting financial literacy, given employees spend more than one-third of their day at the workplace. From tax saving tips to choosing between old and new tas regimes, from short- and long-term goal planning to retirement planning, and from daily budgeting to emergency fund management, employees need help in every aspect of their way.

Moreover, offering financial wellness programs can be a differentiator for employers seeking to attract and retain top talent in today's competitive landscape. Companies prioritizing their workforce's well-being through financial literacy initiatives become more attractive to potential hires in the job market. Effective financial literacy programs can cultivate a culture of financial wellness within the organization by:\\nOrganizing workshops and seminars: These sessions can cover topics like budgeting, saving for retirement, children's education, managing debt, understanding financial products and services, choosing between new and old tax regimes, providing information about educational websites, informative articles, and financial calculators.\\nDeveloping financial wellness environment: Just like ethics and mental health counsellors, companies can have financial health experts like chartered accountants, and certified financial and wealth planners who can offer personalized financial advice are are familiar with budgeting and money management tools.\\nConsidering Incentives: This can include offering incentives for employees who participate in financial literacy programs or complete financial planning workshops which will encourage engagement and proactive steps towards financial well-being.\\nConclusion:\\n\\nPromoting financial literacy among employees is not only a social responsibility, it's also a strategic investment. By equipping their employees with the necessary financial knowledge, organisations can have a more engaged, productive, and healthy workforce. Ultimately, this contributes to building a thriving and sustainable organizational culture.
