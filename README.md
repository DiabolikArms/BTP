# Analysis of Bias in User Engagement on Indian News Media (TOI)

## Overview

This project investigates user engagement bias within the Indian news media, specifically focusing on The Times of India (TOI). As media consumption significantly impacts public opinion, this analysis aims to identify patterns in user interactions that align with specific political, social, or communal ideologies. By understanding these trends, we aspire to promote media literacy and accountability, contributing to a more balanced media landscape in India.
