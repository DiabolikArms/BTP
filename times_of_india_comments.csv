TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,22.05.2024,"Corporate Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: For individuals seeking higher fixed deposit interest rates than those offered by banks, investing in corporate FDs can be a viable option. Corporate fixed deposits, also known as corporate FDs, are term deposits with fixed interest rates held for a predetermined period, primarily issued by Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFCs) and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs).

According to the SBI securities website quoted by ET, ""The deposit scheme of companies is 'AA/AAA' rated from independent rating agencies like CRISIL, ICRA & CARE (reaffirmed over the long period) which indicates credible track record & high to highest degree of safety when it comes to timely repayment of Interest and Principal investment amount.""
This suggests that investing in corporate FDs can be considered safe, as long as the issuing companies have high credit ratings from reputable agencies.

It is important to note that the returns on corporate FDs are taxable. The interest earned from corporate FDs is taxed according to the individual's marginal tax slab rate. Additionally, a 10% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) is deducted from the interest payable if the total interest earned by an individual is equal to or more than Rs. 5,000 in a financial year, the ET report says.
However, resident individuals can avail exemption from TDS by submitting form 15G / 15H (as applicable), although this declaration must be submitted every financial year until maturity.

When choosing a corporate FD scheme to invest in, consider the following factors:
1. Credit Rating: Select higher-rated corporate FDs based on their credit rating, which indicates the underlying risk of the company.
2. Company Background: Evaluate a company's business viability by referring to its Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis (MD & A).
3.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,02.05.2024,"Are you being overcharged on loan interest? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has identified instances of unfair lending practices by banks and other financial institutions when it comes to charging interest on loans. In response, the RBI has issued a directive urging these institutions to correct their practices and ensure fair treatment of borrowers.
Here are the four key areas where banks have been found to be overcharging borrowers:
In a notification issued by the RBI on April 29, 2024, the following unfair practices by banks and other financial institutions were identified:
- Charging interest from loan sanction date: Some lenders were charging interest from the date the loan was approved or when the loan agreement was signed, instead of from the actual date the money was disbursed to the customer.
- Interest charged from cheque date: For loans disbursed by cheque, some banks were charging interest from the date on the cheque, even though the cheque was given to the customer several days later. This led to customers paying interest for a period when they didn't have access to the funds.

- Charging interest for the full month: Some lenders were charging interest for the entire month even if the loan was disbursed or repaid partway through the month. This caused customers to be overcharged on their loans.
- Counting instalments in advance for interest calculation: In some cases, banks collected one or more instalments in advance but still counted the full loan amount for calculating interest. This meant that customers were paying interest on money they had already repaid.

RBI's response and directives

The RBI has ordered banks to refund customers for any excess interest and additional charges. According to the RBI, these practices violate the principles of fairness and transparency, emphasising that these concerns are significant to the central bank.
The RBI has also advised banks to switch from cheque-based disbursements to online transactions. According to an ET report, it has instructed all banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to review their loan disbursement practices, how they calculate interest, and other fees. Banks should make changes, including updating their systems, to resolve these issues and prevent further unfair practices.
RBI's new initiatives for fair loan practices

The central bank has introduced new measures to ensure banks don't engage in unfair practices when offering loans to customers.
Banks must now provide a Key Fact Statement (KFS) to borrowers in simple, clear language. This document, in a standard format, will contain key loan details like interest rates, EMIs, and other charges. This aims to help borrowers understand the terms before signing a loan contract. Banks will also need to get an acknowledgement from borrowers to confirm they've read and understood the KFS. This rule takes effect on October 1, 2024, for all new retail and MSME loans.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/debt-management/rbi-new-loan-rules-is-your-bank-overcharging-you-on-interest-4-ways-in-which-customers-may-be-paying-extra/articleshow/109781728.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI World Desk,NEWS HOME,30.08.2024,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday as Sullivan concluded a three-day visit focused on maintaining open communication despite rising tensions.
The visit included discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and top military officials, emphasizing the need to prevent competition from escalating into conflict.

Commitment to stable relations

Sullivan stressed the importance of diplomacy in managing US-China relations, saying, ""We believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict or confrontation. The key is responsible management through diplomacy."" This effort comes as both nations seek to stabilize relations ahead of potential changes in the US presidency in January, reported the AP.

Xi Jinping echoed this sentiment, affirming China's commitment to a stable relationship with the United States. ""While great changes have taken place in the two countries and in China-US relations, China's commitment to the goal of a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged,"" he said.
Sullivan added that President Biden is dedicated to managing this consequential relationship responsibly, ensuring that competition doesn't escalate into conflict.

Plans were made for a phone call between Xi and Biden in the coming weeks, with the potential for an in-person meeting at significant international summits later this year. Sullivan noted, ""The likelihood is they'll both be there, and if they are, it would only be natural for them to have the chance to sit down with one another.""
Sensitive issues and military communication

The discussions also addressed sensitive topics, including Taiwan, the South China Sea, and China’s support for Russia. On Taiwan, Gen. Zhang Youxia, one of China’s vice chairs of the Central Military Commission, emphasized, ""Reunification of Taiwan with the mainland is 'the mission and responsibility' of the military,"" demanding that the US cease military interactions with Taiwan.
Sullivan acknowledged the rarity of such exchanges and underscored their importance. ""It is rare that we have the opportunity to have this kind of exchange,"" Sullivan said. The meeting resulted in an agreement for a call between military commanders in the Indo-Pacific region, which Sullivan described as a ""very positive outcome.""
Efforts to manage tensions

A White House statement recognized progress in sustaining military-to-military communications, referencing the upcoming theatre-level call. Danny Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute highlighted the significance of Sullivan's meeting with Xi, noting that Sullivan was seen by the Chinese leadership as ""a direct extension"" of President Biden, and his messaging was viewed as ""coming straight from Biden.""

TOI,EDUCATION,17.12.2023,"UPSC 2024 Expert Guide is an initiative by Times of India where we share expert advice and insights for IAS aspirants. Today, our expert Shubham Aggarwal, Director and Chief Mentor at Vidyapeeth IAS Academy, is sharing his insights on UPSC interviews which follow the Mains. Read on for his suggestions on how you can make the best of your UPSC interview, also known as Personality Test.

The UPSC exam is a prolonged process which engages its aspirants for almost two years to finally make it to the list. From 12-hour-a-day preparation regime, to notifications and form submissions, carefully choosing the optional subject, to the Preliminary stage that eliminates almost all the aspirants, to rigorous intermediary Mains answer writing and finally the interviews, it’s a rigorous journey to say the least. UPSC gives you time frames in batches/slots to appear for the Interview Round. Here are some insights from my own interview experience on how you can maximise your interview scores!
DAF (Detailed Application Form) requires a careful and intelligent approach. If you are not careful, it may turn out to be a self-inflicted death trap! One needs to be smart in filling this form. UPSC asks you some personal details about your mother tongue, place of birth, your family, education/qualifications, existing job, achievements, awards, leadership roles, interests and hobbies, and other accolades. Apart from your past, it also asks you about your future aspirations regarding service preferences, your zone/state cadre preferences, etc. It means that you would be judged at every stage of your life. One can avoid an awkward situation by giving the TRUEST account of life to the interviewers in DAF. You will be asked personal questions on the basis of your DAF only. Because this is your first face to face personal interaction with UPSC, you ought to have true knowledge about what you told them about yourself!
Be careful with interests and hobbies. They are those traits which you like doing in your free time, not for money, but pleasure and you have been doing it regularly, till recently. Let's say cricket is not your hobby if you only played gully cricket in your childhood and have not been in touch. Or, reading may not be your hobby if you read academic books out of compulsion, in order to clear an exam! It would be absurd if you mention a hobby and you cannot answer a question related to it, because you have not experienced it up close and personal.

Be confident. Maintain an upright posture and calm, composed demeanour. Be gentle, yet firm, humble, honest, neat and tidy, simple and sober, ambitious, but not anxious. Have the positive attitude of an ant looking to grab even the last drop of honey! Your ‘Personality Test’ is not about the knowledge you possess, because you have already shown your mettle in the Mains. It is about what type of a person you are. Are you good enough to serve the diverse and vulnerable, underdeveloped people of India? Are you ready to take the challenge or do you still love your comfort zone and wish to sign and move files like a government clerk?

Show them your creative instincts. Demonstrate your problem solving ability, the emotional quotient which you will use when you are put in a tough situation. It’s akin to, let's say controlling a violent mob of protestors at Jantar Mantar. Do not hesitate to give an honest, rational, progressive opinion on any matter.
Be upfront about what you don’t know. Should you be confused in front of the interviewers? It is better to accept, with courtesy, that you do not know something or have no opinion on the same rather than beating around the bush. You will be appreciated for gracefully saying a NO instead of an unconvincing YES!
Listen to them carefully. It's an obvious sign of respect. Do take a moment to think, (or even two moments), speak to the point, nod when they say or explain, wear a gentle smile, do not laugh, maintain a healthy eye contact (do not stare) and put up a magnificent show. Do not ignore the ones sitting beside the one who asked you a question. Orient your face towards all eminent men, give them all the due attention required, focusing more on the interviewer who throws his question.
Be prepared with Current Affairs. I am assuming that you are well aware of the current events, related themes and the controversial issues related to India and the world. Make crisp one/two line answers for these issues. You can practise speaking in the mirror, record yourself in mobile/camera, seek help from family, friends, fellow aspirants and reach out to me for the same without any hesitation because “good mentors are always there”. Best wishes!

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,01.05.2024,"Gold has been a cherished asset for Indian households, consistently delivering impressive returns compared to other investment options. Even as gold prices touch new highs this year, one wonders when the yellow metal will hit levels of Rs 1 lakh, or even Rs 2 lakh? What does historical data on the movement of gold suggest and what should investors do?
Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.
This follows a similar pattern observed in the previous 9-year period, when the price tripled from Rs 8,250 in 2006. Going back further, it took approximately 19 years for the gold price to triple from Rs 2,570 per 10 g in 1987, preceded by tripling cycles of around 8 years and 6 years, states an ET report by Naveen Kumar.
If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone. Here is what experts have to say on future returns and timeline for gold to hit the Rs 2 lakh level:
Gold Prices Outlook:

Gold prices are sensitive to global events, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, which can cause rapid increases in relatively short periods. In the past 5 years, factors like rupee weakness, geopolitical issues, the pandemic, and war have contributed to a 75% increase in gold prices, from Rs 40,000 to over Rs 7,00,000, in just 3.3 years. In contrast, from 2014 to 2018, gold prices only increased by 12%, from Rs 28,000 to Rs 31,250.

Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, states, ""Historical data shows that major global changes, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, can significantly influence gold prices, leading to rapid increases within relatively short periods. The recent past of 5 years has shown rupee weakness as well as geopolitical issues and pandemic and war. All these together have given gold a spurt from Rs 40,000 to Rs 7,00,00+ — a gain of 75% in a matter of 3.3 years. In 2014, gold price was Rs 28,000 and in 2018 it was Rs 31,250, which is only 12% in a matter of 5 years.""
Trivedi also suggests that gold prices could potentially reach Rs 2 lakh within the next 7-12 years, given recent trends.
Some experts, like Surendra Mehta, National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, are even more optimistic about gold prices tripling and crossing Rs 2 lakh. Mehta believes that escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel after Ramzan, as well as China-Taiwan tensions, could bring uncertainty and lead to de-dollarisation. He predicts that these factors, along with heavy paper trading of gold in SGE and Comex, could cause gold prices to triple within the next 6 years.
However, it's important to note that the tripling period for gold prices can vary significantly. Vikram Dhawan, Fund Manager and Head - Commodities at Nippon India Mutual Fund, points out that there has been an instance where the tripling period extended to almost 19 years. Dhawan reminds us that gold, like any other asset, is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns.
He states, ""Like any other asset, gold is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns. However, as long as there is no better alternative, gold will continue to be in great demand from consumers and investors alike, hopefully rising to meet their return expectations.""

Gold is widely regarded as one of the most effective hedges against inflation. According to Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, ""Gold price is directly correlated to inflation. Inflation has been high across geographies and will take time to cool off. As long as inflation remains high, gold prices will continue to get support and see an upward trend in the future.""
The trajectory of inflation will also play a crucial role in determining the pace at which gold prices increase. Hareesh V, Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services, explains, ""Inflation and gold prices often have a complex relationship. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold relatively steady or even increase during times of inflation.""
In addition to inflation, various other factors also contribute to the fluctuations in gold prices. Dhawan elaborates, ""When inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases, leading investors to turn to gold as a store of value, thus driving up its price. This relationship is complex and not always direct, as other economic factors can also impact gold prices during periods of high inflation.""
The availability of gold has remained consistent, and any sudden increase in demand has the potential to drive prices higher in the short term. ""The total supply of gold is limited, which is the one reason the metal is considered a valuable asset. The supply of gold comes from two main sources — mining and recycling. The amount of new gold mined each year is relatively stable. The rest of the demand is usually met by recycling scrap gold,"" says Hareesh.
The growing demand from central banks is expected to persist and may contribute to rising prices. ""There has been large-scale buying from some large central banks as they are considerably increasing their gold holdings — like Russia, China, India, etc. Since the supply of gold is limited, this increase in sovereign treasury holdings will continue to put pressure on supply and will support gold prices. We do not see the supply-side pressure easing in the near future as the risk of geopolitical conflicts does not seem to be easing,"" says Gahlaut.

While jewellery has traditionally been a significant driver of demand, it may not continue to play the same role in the future. However, the demand for bullion is anticipated to increase. ""I can see that in a country like India, gold is converting its orbit from consumption item to investment item at a much faster pace. So, sale of jewellery will keep dropping with improved sale of bullion due to financialisation of gold,"" says Mehta.
The shifting dynamics of the global landscape may have a lasting effect on the trajectory of gold prices. Dhawan suggests, ""A decline in the credit rating of the US, whether actual or perceived, may propel gold into a multi-decade bull run. Re-globalisation leading to competitive currency devaluations, along with trade disputes, is conducive for gold prices. On the positive side, bigger and wealthier emerging economies that have a cultural affinity towards gold, like India, may lead to a material increase in gold consumption, underpinning the prices.""
If the present situations persist or intensify, gold prices are expected to surge even higher. Gahlaut states, ""Any escalation of regional or global conflicts, outright wars breaking out, and dollar domination coming under pressure as a global currency can lead to a spike in gold prices. While returns from gold are not linear, gold will continue to play an important role as a risk reduction tool and as a hedge against inflation.""
The implementation of ESG regulations could potentially cause a significant decrease in the supply of gold. Dhawan explains, ""The strict adoption of environmental, social & governance (ESG) rules worldwide is a threat to gold production. This is because gold mines are among the most expensive and most toxic places.""
Gold prices: What should investors do?

When considering whether to link your investment strategy to the rapid tripling of gold prices, it's essential to approach the decision with caution. ""In conclusion, the trajectory of gold prices will be shaped by a combination of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, the fundamental role of gold as a safe-haven asset suggests continued potential for growth in the future,"" says Trivedi.
Incorporating gold into your investment portfolio can be a wise choice for diversification purposes. ""Diversifying investments and considering different assets, including gold, can help mitigate risks associated with inflation. During deflationary phases, gold tends to perform well compared to most asset classes,"" says Dhawan.

However, it's crucial not to base your entire gold investment strategy solely on the expectation of its tripling potential. ""While it is impossible to predict how long gold will take to triple from the current level, it is important to note that as an asset class, gold plays a critical role as a hedge against inflation, volatility, geopolitical and currency risks and, therefore, will remain an important part of asset allocation in a person's portfolio,"" says Gahlaut.
Investing in gold can be beneficial at any time when you are aiming to diversify your investment portfolio. Nevertheless, as the price of gold continues to rise, there may be opportunities to purchase gold during dips in the market. ""Higher prices may eventually lead to reactions from the supply side. However, as gold is under-owned and global gold ETF holdings are at a five-year low, pullbacks may bring in dip buying from investors. Moreover, central banks continue to be net buyers,"" says Dhawan.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-will-gold-prices-hit-rs-2-lakh-mark-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/109750709.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI World Desk,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"George Clooney lauded President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, drawing a parallel to George Washington's historic resignation. Clooney's remarks follow his New York Times op-ed urging the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a new nominee.
“The person who should be applauded is the president, who did the most selfless thing that anybody’s done since George Washington,” Clooney said during an interview at the Venice Film Festival on Sunday.
He emphasized that Biden's choice to exit the race, despite the controversy and behind-the-scenes efforts by party leaders, should be remembered as a noble sacrifice. “All the machinations that got us there, none of that’s gonna be remembered, and it shouldn’t be,” he added.
Clooney's op-ed, titled “I Love Joe Biden, But We Need a New Nominee,” expressed admiration for Biden while acknowledging the toll age had taken on him. Clooney highlighted Biden's performance in a debate against Donald Trump as a clear indication that the president was no longer the formidable figure he once was. “The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe Biden of 2020,” Clooney wrote.
The call for Biden’s departure was part of a broader push by Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who were concerned about Biden’s impact on their own re-election prospects. Biden, in his first interview since exiting the race, revealed that party elites were a significant factor in his decision. “A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,” Biden told “CBS News Sunday Morning,” explaining that staying in the race would have been a distraction.

Clooney, reflecting on Biden’s choice, praised the president's willingness to make a difficult decision for the greater good. “What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who … you know, it’s very hard to let go of power. We know that. We’ve seen it all around the world,” Clooney said. “And for someone to say, ‘I think there’s a better way forward,’ all the credit goes to him, and that’s really the truth.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/clooney-hails-bidens-decision-to-exit-2024-race-his-withdrawal-a-selfless-act-echoing-george-washington/articleshow/112989548.cms,,,,,,,,,

HAMIRPUR: In a striking demonstration of communal harmony in Himachal Pradesh, a Nepalese Hindu man residing in a village with a predominantly Muslim population was both cared for and cremated by his Muslim neighbours, along with Hindu families.
Nearly five decades ago, a young boy Ashok Kumar, believed to be aged between 8 and 10 years, arrived at Banh village, Hamirpur district, with a group of Nepalese youth seeking work in India, said Meena Kumari, pardhan of Jol Sapper Panchayat.

However, the boy was either abandoned or separated from his group and had nowhere to go and was taken in by the residents, who were predominantly Muslim. Among them, one Muslim family offered him shelter, welcomed him into their home, and provided him with the care and support he needed, she said.
Over time Ashok grew up and started working as a labourer and became a mason and lived happily in the village.

Sometime back when Ashok fell gravely ill, it was the local Muslim residents who stepped forward to care for him. They provided him with medical attention and admitted him to Tanda hospital but as fate would have, Ashok passed away, she said, adding that his cremation was carried out on Saturday jointly by local Muslims and Hindu residents of the village, as per the Hindu traditions.
Vice-president of the All India Gujjar Mahasabha, Jan Muhammad, said: ""God created man. While religions may differ, maintaining communal harmony is crucial for upholding brotherhood and unity.""

Kumari said this gesture is a remarkable display of unity. ""By honoring his last rites according to Hindu traditions, the Muslim residents not only fulfilled a significant cultural duty but also demonstrated their commitment to communal harmony,"" she added.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.
However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy.
Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management. When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.
Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.

Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:
Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores.
Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money.
Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings. This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey.
Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing.
Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children.
Encourage Smart Shopping: Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.
By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,NEWS HOME,01.09.2024,"JERUSALEM: Palestinian militants killed three Israeli police officers on Sunday when they opened fire on a vehicle in the occupied West Bank, where Israel has carried out large-scale raids in recent days.
The attack took place along a road in the southern West Bank. The raids have mainly been focused on urban refugee camps in the northern part of the territory, where Israeli forces have traded fire with militants on a near-daily basis since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.

The police confirmed that all three killed were officers and said the assailants slipped away. A little-known militant group calling itself the Khalil al-Rahman Brigade claimed responsibility. Hamas praised the attack as a ""natural response"" to the war in Gaza and called for more.
The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there.

Concerned about this neglect, he noted that, like government employees nationwide, DTC workers live under the constant threat of privatisation, he said.

""These are the people who run India, make the journey of lakhs of passengers smooth every day - but if they have gotten anything in return for their dedication, it is only injustice,"" he said.
The demands are clear - equal work, equal pay, complete justice, the Congress leader said.

TOI World Desk,NEWS HOME,31.08.2024,"China on Saturday accused a Philippine Coast Guard vessel of intentionally colliding with a Chinese ship, further escalating tensions over contested areas in the South China Sea.
Chinese Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said that the Philippine ship with hull number 9701 collided with the Chinese ship 5205 just after 12.06 pm (04:06 GMT) on Saturday. Liu claimed that the Philippine ship manoeuvred in an ""unprofessional and dangerous manner, resulting in a collision,"" while asserting that the Chinese ship was operating within regulations, without providing any specifics.
In response, the Philippines has levelled charges against China, accusing the Chinese Coast Guard vessel of deliberately ramming and colliding with the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times, despite no provocation from the Philippine Coast Guard.

Jay Tarriela, a Philippine Coast Guard official, said, ""This afternoon, the Chinese Coast Guard vessel deliberately rammed and collided with the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times, despite no provocation from the Philippine Coast Guard.""

Tarriela also shared images on X depicting the damage sustained by BRP Teresa Magbanua due to the ""unprovoked ramming by China Coast Guard 5205.""

China's rapid military expansion and increasing assertiveness in pursuing its claim to nearly the entire South China Sea, which is vital to international trade, have led to more frequent confrontations, primarily with the Philippines, whose security the US is treaty-bound to ensure.

The long-standing territorial disputes also involve other claimants, including Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. China has rejected a ruling by a UN-backed arbitration panel that negated almost all of Beijing's historically-based claims in the South China Sea.
The head of US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, recently said that the US military is open to consultations about escorting Philippine ships in the disputed waters amid the increase in hostilities.
Chinese coast guard, navy, and suspected militia ships regularly clash with Philippine vessels during attempts to resupply Filipino sailors stationed in parts of the South China Sea claimed by both countries. As these clashes grow increasingly hostile, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to their ships, the Philippine government has faced questions about invoking the treaty alliance with Washington.
The latest incident occurred just days after Chinese and Philippine coast guard ships collided near Sabina Shoal, a disputed atoll located approximately 140 kilometres (85 miles) west of the Philippine province of Palawan, within the Philippines' internationally recognized exclusive economic zone.
The atoll is near Second Thomas Shoal, another flashpoint where China has hampered the resupply of Philippine forces. Both countries reached an agreement last month to prevent further confrontations at the shoal.
In a separate incident on Saturday, Japan lodged a formal protest via China's embassy against what it called an incursion by a Chinese survey ship into its territorial waters. This incident has fueled unease among Japanese defense officials, who are already concerned about the growing military cooperation between the Chinese and Russian air forces.
On Monday, Tokyo also protested a Chinese military aircraft briefly entering Japan's southwestern airspace. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that his country had ""no intention"" to violate any country's airspace.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/watch-philippines-and-chinese-vessels-collide-in-south-china-sea/articleshow/112953476.cms,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we understand when unclaimed dividends and shares make way to the Investor Education and Protection Fund and what investors should do.
Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has revealed that over 70% of demat accounts with single ownership lack nomination, creating hurdles for legal beneficiaries to access their shares and dividends.

According to an ET report, approximately Rs 55,700 crore of unclaimed shares and dividends have been transferred to the government's Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) due to this issue. Shares and dividends become unclaimed if not claimed for seven consecutive years, whether in dematerialised or physical form.

Sanchit Garg, co-founder of GLC Wealth, says that forgetfulness or lack of awareness about these investments are the primary reasons for securities remaining unclaimed.
Many individuals still hold shares in physical form, leading to challenges such as lost documents, address changes, dormant bank accounts, relocation, or decease. Recovering these investments can take one to three years, says Garg. This involves the consolidation of all relevant information and updating KYC details and account information.

To begin with, gather all pertinent information from records such as physical share certificates, dividends, allotment letters, and income tax returns. Ensure completeness by checking old investment records or notes. Update KYC details, signatures, and bank and demat account information in the company's records. If share certificates are lost, apply for duplicate shares.
In the event of a deceased shareholder, legal heirs must handle the transmission process, including potential court proceedings based on investment value, as noted by Garg.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,16.05.2024,"Investors who have relied on gold as a safe haven asset in their portfolios in recent years might contemplate diversifying a portion of their holdings into silver, as it shows potential to outshine gold this year. According to experts, silver has lagged behind gold in the recent rally of precious metals, but with the possibility of further increases in industrial metals worldwide, silver could see a surge of 15-20% from its current levels.
This could potentially push its value beyond Rs 100,000 per kilogram within the next year. As of now, silver is trading at Rs 84,984 per kg on the MCX.
""We have a very strong bet that China will recover in the third quarter of 2024,"" Navneet Damani, group senior vice-president at Motilal Oswal Securities told ET's Nikita Periwal. ""In the last three to five years, silver has moved more like an industrial metal than a precious metal, and once there is recovery in China, silver can also take off,"" he said.

Damani recommends buying silver on dips of up to Rs 80,000 per kg, anticipating a 15-20% upside in silver prices, compared to the 3-5% expected in gold.

Although both gold and silver reached their all-time highs in the domestic market earlier in 2024, the gold-to-silver ratio, a key indicator, suggests that silver prices have not increased as much as gold. The current ratio is slightly above 85, significantly higher than its historical range of 65-75, indicating that silver is likely to experience higher gains in the future, according to analysts.
While heightened volatility in India ahead of general elections and the anticipated easing of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve are expected to support the prices of both gold and silver, silver will have the added benefit of its various industrial applications, including usage in solar panels, electric vehicles, semiconductors, other renewable energy sources, and certain electronic and consumer durables.

""Over the medium-to-long term, we are extremely bullish on silver, and we see silver outperforming in the long run because industrial demand will pick up, including from solar panel manufacturers and other green technologies,"" Tapan Patel, fund manager at Tata Asset Management told the financial daily.
Patel recommends that investors maintain a combination of both gold and silver in their portfolio, given the current market environment. ""If investors are looking at a 10-15% exposure to bullion, then 60-70% should be gold,"" he said.
Shashank Pal, the chief business officer at PL Wealth Management, believes that silver is bound to rise, potentially more than gold over a year, due to its lack of appreciation in recent years compared to gold and its increased industrial applications.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/silver-set-to-outperform-gold-precious-metal-likely-to-cross-rs-1-lakh-mark-over-1-year-horizon/articleshow/110167095.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI News Desk,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"NEW DELHI: BJP MP Kangana Ranaut on Monday expressed her discontent with the OTT series 'IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack,' accusing its creators of manipulating historical events to align with their political agendas.
The Mandi MP criticized the alleged freedom granted to OTT platforms to showcase violence and nudity without repercussions or censorship, while films with nationalistic themes face scrutiny from the censor board.
Kangana's remarks come at a time when the release of her film 'Emergency' which is also directed by her, has been postponed.
""Law of the land is that one can show unimaginable amount of violence and nudity on OTT platforms without any consequence or censorship, one can even distort real life events to suit their politically motivated sinister motives, there is all the freedom for communists or leftists across the world for such anti national expressions but as a nationalist no OTT platform allows us to make films that revolves around the integrity and unity of Bharat, it seems censorship is only for some of us who don't want tukde of this nation and make films on historic facts,"" Kangana said in a post on X.

""It’s hugely demotivating and unjust,"" she added.
The film, where Kangana is playing the role of ex-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was originally scheduled to be released in theaters on September 6. However, it is currently awaiting approval from the CBFC (Central Board Of Film Certification), which has proposed several cuts due to the sensitive nature of the movie's subject matter.
The series 'IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack,' created by
Anubhav Sinha, has been accused of allegedly shifting the blame away from the Pakistani terrorists involved in the 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight. The Bharatiya Janata Party has also accused the series of validating the criminal intentions of the terrorists by using their non-Muslim aliases.
BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya expressed his concerns on X, stating, ""The hijackers of IC-814 were dreaded terrorists, who acquired aliases to hide their Muslim identities. Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha, legitimised their criminal intent, by furthering their non-Muslim names. Result? Decades later, people will think Hindus hijacked IC-814.""
The series, directed by Sinha, is based on the 1999 hijacking of an Indian aircraft that took place on December 24, 1999, after the plane departed from Kathmandu, Nepal. The crisis concluded with the release of three terrorists – Masood Azhar, Omar Sheikh, and Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar – in exchange for approximately 150 hostages. The series was released on Netflix on August 29.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/censorship-only-for-kangana-ranaut-reacts-to-netflix-series-ic-814-row/articleshow/112984168.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,SPEAKING TREE,31.08.2024,"The ability to be aware of our thoughts, feelings and actions is unique to humans. This self-awareness is what differentiates us from animals, and deepening it is fundamental to our personal evolution. The term self-awareness can mean different things to different people. In my experience, there are five distinct levels of self-awareness, each representing a progressively deeper understanding of ourselves.
TOP PICKS FOR YOU
Transforming Our Reality Through Soul Consciousness
Be Like Radha, Transcend The Dance Of Thoughts
Tough to be The Brahman
This progression can also guide us when we are trying to change any behaviour or habit.
The first level of self-awareness involves recognising our common behaviour patterns and visible personality traits. For example: ""I often get angry.""
If we wish to change this trait, we need to examine it more closely: how often does it happen, what's the intensity of the anger, how long does it last, what triggers it.
Moving inwards, the second level involves being aware of our recurring thoughts and feelings. For example: ""When my teenagers don't listen to my advice, I feel frustrated and worry they will make big mistakes. This makes me angry.""

Here, we are aware not only of the angry behaviour but also of the thoughts and feelings that accompany it. To expand our awareness, it's useful to observe the impact our anger has on others and ourselves. How do the children feel, what are they learning about power dynamics and anger, how do we feel afterwards, was the anger worth it?
We usually recognise our recurring thoughts and feelings when we choose to pause and reflect. But at the third level, we are in tune with our constantly changing thoughts and feelings as they subtly arise within us, whether they are linked with insecurity, envy, greed, love, empathy, or generosity.

Example: ""I am aware when thoughts of disapproval or feelings of anxiety and anger arise in me, often accompanied by a tightening sensation in my chest and quicker breathing."" This kind of self-awareness is crucial for change. Such mindfulness allows us to choose different responses instead of reacting in a conditioned way.
Being in touch with our evolving thoughts and feelings paves the way for the fourth level of self-awareness. We then begin to notice the origins of these thoughts and feelings. And we realise our deep-seated conditioned beliefs.
This self-awareness helps us change our behaviour patterns at the root. Identifying our limiting beliefs allows us to explore and adopt healthier ones.
The final level of self-awareness requires a much deeper dive within. It's the most powerful though. It's about becoming aware of our true Self, beyond personality traits, thoughts, feelings and beliefs.
Example: ""I am not my thoughts and feelings. Instead, I am that which is aware of all these thoughts and feelings. The thoughts and feelings change, arise and pass, but I am unchanging and always present. I am complete, whole and enough and not limited to this finite body and mind. I am pure awareness.""
Grasping this can be a paradigm shift in our journey of inner growth. Residing in this awareness brings wholeness, equanimity and deeper peace. In that state, the chances of anger arising diminish substantially.

TOI,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation. Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.
Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.

The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.
On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.
When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.

Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.
BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.
Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.
Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP. Qari Fasihuddin Fitrat, the military chief of Afghan Taliban, denied the accusation saying the militants plan and execute attacks from within Pakistan.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,,,,,,,,,

Rohit Khanna,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"KOLKATA: CBI officers probing financial corruption at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital are looking into alleged scams that were earlier flagged at the institute.
The agency came across documents related to an inquiry committee report related to disposal of biomedical waste at RG Kar, sources said. Improper disposal of biomedical waste was spotted in 2022-2023 and an inquiry panel set up.

The committee report mentioned the name of a worker at the common collection plant of the hospital who was questioned about the biomedical waste. The name of a caretaker of a guest house on the hospital premises also surfaced during the inquiry.
The worker mentioned three names, including that of a security guard close to former principal Sandip Ghosh. It was found that the security guard showed the worker ways to make money from biomedical waste.

Each day, biomedical waste, like syringes, gloves, and used saline bottles, are generated in the hospital. These, when recycled properly, have a huge demand in some of the countries.
The agency also came across names of two biomedical waste recycling firms from other states. The agency is likely to question the two firms, including transporters of the waste.
One firm, which was given the job to transport biomedical waste, was also questioned by the inquiry committee.

The firm alleged that the volume of biomedical waste generated in the hospital was getting lower each day.
After the inquiry report spotted discrepancies, several quarters inside the hospital went on alert and one of the key persons overseeing the operation of the alleged sale of biomedical waste was asked to stay off the radar of any possible probe, sources said.
The agency, which is looking into several allegations of corruption at RG Kar, visited the hospital on Sunday.

TOI World Desk,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"The 2024 presidential race tightened as Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly led Donald Trump, according to the latest poll data. With less than two months remaining until Election Day, Harris gained momentum and held a slight edge over her Republican rival.
Recent polls show Harris leading
A new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.
Among likely voters, Harris’ lead widened to 52% compared to Trump’s 46%. This result was consistent with polling conducted before the Democratic National Convention, where Harris stood at 49% and Trump at 45%.
Pollsters noted that while most numbers remained stable since August, Harris gained ground among women, now leading by 13 points (54% to 41%), up from a 6-point lead before the convention. Harris also received higher marks for her campaign, with 56% of Americans rating her performance as excellent or good, compared to 41% for Trump.

Harris surpasses Biden’s performance in key states
Harris outperformed Trump in the battleground states, maintaining a slight advantage within the margins of error in nearly every national survey. NBC News reported that Harris fared better against Trump than Biden did before his exit, indicating growing confidence in her leadership.
The concept of a margin of error, as explained by Pew Research, refers to the range within which a survey result is expected to fall relative to the true population value. While Harris' lead was within this range, it underscored the competitive nature of the race.

Trump’s strengths and weaknesses
Despite Harris’ lead, Trump maintained advantages in areas critical to voters. He outperformed Harris on trust regarding key issues such as the economy and inflation, leading by 8 points in each category. Trump also had a 9-point lead over Harris on handling the US-Mexico border. However, Harris was perceived as more trustworthy on protecting American democracy and Supreme Court appointments.
The latest polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ also showed Harris with a 3.8-point national lead over Trump. The ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted from August 23-27 with 2,496 completed interviews, had a margin of sampling error of 2.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.
Trump’s consistent base
Despite Harris' gains, Trump remained a formidable opponent, consistently polling at around 47% nationwide. Polls conducted by The Wall Street Journal, EPIC-MRA in Michigan, and Bloomberg/Morning Consult in Georgia and Michigan all placed Trump at this level of support. However, the overall trend showed a reversal in fortunes since Biden's departure, with Harris now holding a narrow edge.
Swing state dynamics
Swing state polls revealed a complex and evolving landscape. Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls indicated that Harris had overtaken Trump within the margin of error in Georgia (50%), Michigan (49%), Nevada (50%), and Pennsylvania (51%). In Wisconsin, she held a more decisive lead at 53%, while she was tied with Trump in Arizona and North Carolina. This sharply contrasted with Biden’s performance in these states, where he struggled to gain traction.
Before Harris took over the Democratic ticket, Biden trailed Trump, even before the June 27 debate that further damaged his campaign. Harris, on the other hand, was now seen as a more trusted leader and was performing better across the board.
Additional polls from The Wall Street Journal, Quinnipiac, and Suffolk/USA Today also showed Harris in the lead, with percentages ranging from 48% to 49%. Trump remained close behind, polling between 43% and 48% in these surveys.
Poll insights and campaign implications
The ABC News/Ipsos poll reflected Harris’ ability to leverage her campaign effectively, despite the race remaining highly competitive. Trump, while maintaining a solid base, faced challenges in closing the gap with Harris, who managed to capitalize on recent Democratic momentum.
As both campaigns intensified their efforts, the upcoming weeks were crucial in determining whether Harris could sustain her lead or if Trump would make a comeback. With the presidential election just around the corner, all eyes were on how these dynamics evolved.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elctions-2024-harris-edges-out-trump-new-polls-show-vice-president-leading-in-key-battlegrounds/articleshow/112978193.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,BUSINESS,01.03.2024,"KARACHI: Pakistan's consumer price index for February was up 23.1% from the same month last year, marking the slowest rate of annual inflation since June 2022, data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.
The country has been struggling with soaring inflation, which last May hit an all-time high of 38% on an annual basis, partly driven by new taxation measures the government imposed to comply with International Monetary Fund demands.
Islamabad's funding agreement with the IMF expires on April 11.
On a month-on-month basis the February CPI was unchanged, having risen every month since the fiscal year began last July.
Pakistan's finance ministry projected in a monthly report on Thursday that inflation would hover around 24.5%-25.5% in February, with expectations of further easing to 23.5%-24.5% in March as the crop situation and the supply of commodities improves.

In January, Pakistan's central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 22% for the fifth policy-setting meeting in a row and raised its full-year inflation projections.
The governor of the State Bank of Pakistan said the rise in its average inflation forecast for the fiscal year ending in June to 23%-25% from a previous projection of 20%-22% was due to increasing gas and electricity prices.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistan-inflation-slows-to-23-1-yr/yr-in-feb-lowest-since-mid-2022/articleshow/108141023.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,17.05.2024,"PAN-Aadhaar for Gold buying: The purchase of precious metals like gold and silver is a tradition considered auspicious during festivals. However, amidst the joy of buying, it's important to be aware of the regulations surrounding gold transactions, especially when using cash. With 24 Karat gold prices hovering around Rs 74,000 per gram, it's wise to understand the rules for purchasing gold jewellery.
As per an ET report, the government has made buying gold with cash stricter by bringing the gems and jewellery sector under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.
This move, announced on December 28, 2020, requires jewellers to comply with KYC norms, such as requesting PAN or Aadhaar for cash transactions above a specified limit, and reporting large value cash transactions of Rs 10 lakh and above to the government.
Additionally, recent years have seen tightening of rules regarding cash transactions under the Income Tax Act, 1961, including TDS on cash withdrawals exceeding specified limits and restrictions on the maximum amount of cash transaction in a single day between individuals.
So, how much gold can someone purchase with cash without needing to provide PAN or Aadhaar at the time of the transaction? Also, what is the maximum limit for cash transactions according to income tax laws?

Income tax laws on cash transactions for gold purchase

Income tax laws restrict cash transactions above a certain amount. Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act prohibits cash transactions exceeding Rs 2 lakh in a single day, either from one person or related to one event or occasion. If you buy gold jewellery with cash for more than Rs 2 lakh in a single day, you'll violate the income tax law. In such cases, the receiver of the cash is liable to pay a penalty equal to the amount transacted in cash under Section 271D of the Income Tax Act, states the ET report.

ET illustrates this with an example: If an individual purchases gold jewellery for Rs 4 lakh in cash, exceeding the Rs 2 lakh limit set by Section 269ST, a penalty applies under Section 271D. This penalty equals the cash transaction amount. In this case, with a cash transaction of Rs 4 lakh, the receiver (the jeweller) would be liable to pay a Rs 4 lakh penalty. Since the penalty falls on the receiver, jewellers are hesitant to engage in cash transactions exceeding Rs 2 lakh.

PAN and Aadhaar requirements for gold purchases

According to Stuti Galiya, Partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, providing PAN details is compulsory for gold purchases valued at Rs 2 lakh and above under Rule 114B of the Income Tax Rules of 1962. Therefore, whether you buy gold for more than Rs 2 lakh per transaction, regardless of the payment method (cash or electronic), you must furnish PAN details to the jewellers.
The PMLA rules require PAN or Aadhaar for transactions above a certain threshold.
Galiya further explains that PAN/Aadhaar is necessary for all transactions over Rs 2 lakh. In practice, jewellers who don't accept cash above this limit from a single person when selling gold jewellery comply with Income Tax Act provisions and aren't affected by the December 2020 PMLA notification, unless they suspect the transaction is suspicious. It's important to note that some companies and jewellers have their own extra procedures for verifying customer identity.
Meghna Mishra, partner at Karanjawala & Co., states that under the PMLA rules, individuals can conduct high-value cash transactions if they undergo KYC compliance. For purchases of gold jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh and above, individuals must provide PAN or Aadhaar, even for electronic payments. However, Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act restricts cash transactions over Rs 2 lakh for individuals. Therefore, KYC compliance isn't required for transactions (cash or electronic) below Rs 2 lakh, she says.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/how-much-gold-can-you-buy-in-cash-and-are-pan-aadhaar-details-mandatory-heres-what-legal-experts-say/articleshow/110208387.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,SPEAKING TREE,13.08.2024,"In the realm of Feng Shui, the right wallet can be a powerful tool for attracting financial abundance and prosperity. By aligning your wallet choice with specific Feng Shui principles and colors, you can enhance your financial energy and open the door to greater wealth. Here are 12 essential Feng Shui wallet tips and colors to help you attract wealth and financial success:
1. Opt for High-Quality Materials
Choose a wallet made from high-quality materials such as leather or durable fabric.
In Feng Shui, quality items symbolize wealth and prosperity, encouraging positive energy flow and attracting financial success.

2. Keep Your Wallet Organized
A cluttered wallet can block the flow of wealth. Regularly declutter and organize your wallet to ensure it’s tidy and easy to use. This practice promotes financial clarity and efficiency.

3. Choose the Right Color

The color of your wallet plays a significant role in attracting wealth. Here’s a guide to the most auspicious wallet colors:
Red: Symbolizes wealth and prosperity. Red is a powerful color for attracting financial success and energizing your wealth corner.
Green: Represents growth and abundance. Green wallets are ideal for those seeking to expand their financial opportunities and cultivate wealth.
Gold: Associated with wealth and luxury. A gold wallet can enhance your financial status and attract high-value opportunities.
Black: Symbolizes stability and protection. A black wallet can provide a solid foundation for your finances and help manage your wealth effectively.
Purple: Linked to spiritual growth and transformation. Purple wallets are great for those looking to attract unconventional financial gains and elevate their financial status.
Blue: Represents calm and stability. A blue wallet can help maintain financial balance and attract steady income.

4. Avoid Excessive Cash
Keeping too much cash in your wallet can create unnecessary stress and block financial flow. Carry only what you need to maintain a sense of abundance without overloading your wallet.

5. Use the Wallet's Wealth Corner
Place your wallet in the wealth corner of your home or office, typically the far-left corner from the entrance. This placement enhances the wallet’s ability to attract financial energy and support wealth accumulation.

6. Avoid Negative Symbols
Avoid wallets with negative symbols or designs that might invoke bad luck or financial loss. Opt for simple, positive, and auspicious designs to maintain a harmonious energy flow.

7. Regularly Refresh Your Wallet
Periodically update or replace your wallet to keep the energy fresh. A new wallet symbolizes new opportunities and revitalizes your financial energy.

8. Keep Your Wallet in Good Condition
A well-maintained wallet reflects a positive attitude towards money. Repair or replace damaged wallets promptly to ensure a continued flow of prosperity.

9. Use Feng Shui Symbols
Incorporate small Feng Shui symbols of wealth, such as coins or crystals, into your wallet. These symbols can enhance the wallet’s energy and attract financial blessings.

10. Practice Gratitude
Show appreciation for your wallet and the money it holds. Gratitude increases the positive energy surrounding your finances and encourages a flow of abundance.

11. Avoid Mixing Personal and Business Finances
Keep your personal and business finances separate. Use different wallets for personal and business transactions to maintain clarity and focus on your financial goals.

12. Perform a Ritual Cleansing
Occasionally perform a Feng Shui cleansing ritual for your wallet to remove any negative energy. This can involve placing your wallet in sunlight or using purification crystals to reset its energy.

TOI World Desk,NEWS HOME,31.08.2024,"Workers on Wednesday dismantled the final dams on a crucial section of the Klamath River, US. This action cleared the way for salmon to swim freely for the first time in a century. The removal is part of the largest dam removal project in US history.
Yurok tribal member and attorney, Amy Bowers Cordalis, had tears in her eyes as she witnessed the return of the river: “It was surreal.
It was so emotional. I felt so hopeful and so satisfied that we have restored this river,"" she said. ""And looking at it you could almost hear the river crying, ‘I am free, I am free', as reported by the Associated Press.
Cordalis is engaged in a battle for the removal of Klamath damns since 2002 when she witnessed thousands of salmon die in the river due to a bacterial outbreak caused by low and warm temperatures.
As the river flows freely once more, how quickly the salmon will return to their historical habitats remains uncertain. Early reports suggest that salmon have already begun their journey upstream. Michael Belchik, senior water policy analyst for the Yurok Tribe, said,“I think we’re going to have some early successes. I’m pretty confident we’ll see some fish going above the dam. If not this year, then for sure next year.”

This demolition is set to be completed in the coming month and is part of a nationwide movement to restore rivers to their natural flows and revive ecosystems. According to the advocacy group American Rivers, more than 2,000 dams have been removed in the US in the last 25 years.
Crews used excavators to dismantle rock dams that had been diverting water upstream of the nearly removed Iron Gate and Copco No 1 dams. This restoration
happened just in time for the king salmon to start their spawning season.
“I am excited to move into the restoration phase of the Klamath River,"" said Russell ‘Buster’ Attebery, chairman of the Karuk Tribe. ""Restoring hundreds of miles of spawning grounds and improving water quality will help support the return of our salmon, a healthy, sustainable food source for several Tribal Nations.""
Salmon are not just an ecologically important species but also hold cultural and spiritual significance for the Indigenous tribes in the region. The Klamath River was once the third-largest salmon-producing river on the West Coast. However, the construction of dams by PacifiCorp between 1918 and 1962 to generate electricity disrupted the salmon’s lifecycle, decreasing their population.
The removal of these dams is expected to have minimal impact on the local energy supply. While hydroelectric power is considered clean and renewable, the ecological damage caused by large dams has increasingly led to their removal, particularly in the western United States.
Mark Bransom, CEO of the Klamath River Renewal Corporation noted that it took about a decade for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe to resume fishing after the removal of the Elwha dams. “It’ll take some time. You can’t undo 100 years’ worth of damage and impacts to a river system overnight"", he said
On the other hand, Oregon state Senator Dennis Linthicum has argued that the removal of damn eliminates important sites for water storage, flood control, and fire prevention.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-could-almost-hear-the-river-crying-i-am-free-tribes-celebrate-as-dams-fall-in-us-river-freeing-salmon-trapped-for-a-century/articleshow/112940759.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,29.02.2024,"Bank locker rules: Do you have a bank locker or are you considering opening one? This article is essential for understanding the intricacies and your entitlements as a customer.
The objective is to provide comprehensive understanding regarding bank locker agreements, associated charges, pertinent fine print, and rights as customers.
Bank locker rules: 5 things to know

The primary point to grasp is that individuals can open a locker at any bank, regardless of whether they hold an existing banking account there or not. Even if you have no prior relationship with a bank, you are still eligible to obtain a safe deposit locker. For instance, suppose you maintain your salary account at Bank A, your savings at Bank B, and there's Bank C nearby where you have no affiliations. In such a scenario, you can still approach Bank C. While you'll need to complete the KYC process, you can still secure a bank locker at that specific bank.
Another common issue, which many people encounter, is when banks inform them that no lockers are available. However, following the change in RBI norms in August 2021, banks are now obligated to maintain a record of vacant lockers as well as a waitlist of customers. Therefore, when you apply for a locker at a bank, they are required to acknowledge your application, respond to it, and either allocate you a locker if available according to your preference, or provide you with a waitlist number. This ensures transparency and accountability in the process of locker allocation.
The third aspect to consider is that the bank might request you to open a Fixed Deposit (FD) if you intend to secure a locker. This requirement typically applies to new customers, particularly those who are new to the bank. While this may seem stringent, the underlying rationale is to ensure that the bank has recourse in the event of defaults or neglect of the locker. The bank cannot demand an FD for any arbitrary amount; it must be for a specific sum. According to the regulations, the FD must be funded with an amount equivalent to three years' worth of rent, along with any charges specified by the bank for breaking open the locker if rent has not been paid for three years and there have been no operations conducted on the locker.
Many people overlook the importance of nominations when it comes to lockers. However, it is mandatory for banks to provide a nomination facility. It is crucial to have a nominee associated with your locker and comprehend the procedures for selecting, changing, or understanding the rights and powers of the nominee. Additionally, it is essential to understand what actions the nominee must take in the unfortunate event that the locker holder passes away.
The final and crucial point to remember is that whatever items you store in the locker are not insured. The bank cannot offer insurance for the contents of your locker. While the bank does bear some liability, it is limited. The bank’s liability is limited to 100 times the annual locker rent. If your annual locker rent amounts to Rs 5000, you will be safeguarded against losses up to Rs 5 lakhs. This coverage extends to events such as fire, theft, robbery, and building collapse. Therefore, if you store valuable items such as jewelry in the locker, it is advisable to have them professionally appraised and insured separately.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/bank-locker-rules-5-things-to-know-if-you-have-a-bank-locker-or-plan-to-open-one/articleshow/108098401.cms,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,Manisha Anand,"Whatever RBI rules are, its impossible to get a bank locker without a hefty FD. I have experienced myself in Axis Bank. I don't know what they do, but show us the list & then say ,a few lockers will be available after a month as clients are leaving the country.

Reports indicate that a coal-fired power plant near the city and an oil refinery within the city limits were targeted during the attack.
A local official reported that three drones had attempted to strike the Kashira coal-fired power station.
The official said, ""There were no victims nor damages,"" and added that electricity was still being supplied to clients ""correctly.""
Russian news agencies also reported a fire at the Moscow oil refinery in Kapotnya, although mayor Sergei Sobyanin confirmed that there were no casualties or damage.

The majority of the drones, totaling 122, were neutralized over the regions of Kursk, Bryansk, Voronezh, and Belgorod, which share borders with Ukraine, according to the Russian defence ministry. Regional governor Aleksandr Bogomaz said, ""Our defenders are repelling an attempted massive UAV attack on the territory of the Bryansk region.""
Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov of the Belgorod region said, ""The glass of three residential buildings in Belgorod is damaged. In one private residence, a utility building was completely destroyed.""

This drone barrage follows one of the most significant attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which involved over 200 Russian drones and missiles. Since the beginning of Russia's campaign in Ukraine in February 2022, both sides have targeted each other's energy infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones on Wednesday attacked two fuel depots in southwest Russia's Rostov region and the northern Kirov region, causing them to catch fire.
Earlier, Ukraine launched an offensive in Russia's Kursk region, even as Russian forces continue to make steady progress in eastern Ukraine.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-thwarts-large-scale-drone-attack-by-ukraine-shot-down-over-150-drones/articleshow/112965071.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,02.04.2024,"New penal charge, interest rules on loans from April 1: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced fresh guidelines regarding penal charges and penal interest on loan accounts, effective from April 1. These rules stop banks and finance companies from charging borrowers extra for missing loan payments or breaking other loan rules. Here’s what the new RBI rules on penal charges mean for borrowers and lenders:
New RBI rules for penal charges, interest

As per the new directives, the RBI has stopped banks and finance companies from charging penal interest, usually imposed on customers for late EMI payments.
They also can't add extra charges to the interest rate. However, banks can still charge penalties. But, they must not add these charges to the loan amount or calculate additional interest on them, states an ET report.
The purpose of imposing penal interest and charges is to encourage responsible credit behavior, not to boost revenue. However, the RBI's review revealed that banks and finance companies often use these charges to increase their income, causing complaints and disagreements among customers.

Penal charges vs penal interest

When borrowers default or fail to comply, lenders typically impose penalties, which can take the form of fixed charges (penal charges) or additional interest (penal interest). Penal charges are a set fee, separate from the interest, while penal interest is an extra rate added onto the customer's existing interest rate. The RBI instructed banks not to include penal charges in the loan amount and not to calculate additional interest on these charges.

Implementation timeline

The new guidelines apply to all new loans starting from April 1. Existing loans will be subject to the norms starting from June 1, 2024. The RBI postponed the implementation date from January 1 to April 1 to give financial institutions more time to adjust. Both retail and corporate borrowers will face identical penalties for the same loan product.

Determining penal charges

Banks will apply charges based on the defaulted amount. The RBI has instructed lenders to impose charges fairly and consistently according to their board-approved policy. While penal charges should be reasonable, the RBI has not specified a maximum limit for these charges.
Applicability to other loan products

TOI,SPEAKING TREE,29.12.2023,"The concept of the immortality of the soul, as expounded in the Bhagavad Gita, holds a profound significance within Hindu philosophy. The Gita, a revered scripture, encompasses various aspects of life, spirituality, and duty, addressing the eternal nature of the soul (Atman) and its relationship with the transient human existence.
According to the Gita, the soul is immortal and transcends the physical body.

What does Death mean in different religions
What is the ideology behind Yoga
It is described as eternal, indestructible, and unchanging. Lord Krishna, the divine charioteer and teacher, imparts wisdom to Arjuna, emphasizing the eternal nature of the self. He elucidates that the soul is beyond birth and death, not subject to destruction by any physical means.
Krishna enlightens Arjuna on the concept of reincarnation or rebirth (samsara) – the continuous cycle of birth and death. The body is considered akin to clothing that the eternal soul dons and discards. Just as a person discards old garments and wears new ones, the soul passes from one body to another in the cycle of rebirth.
The soul, being immortal, remains unaffected by the physical manifestations of life, such as birth, growth, decay, and death. It is beyond the constraints of time and space, unblemished by any physical or mental attributes. Krishna urges Arjuna not to grieve for what is inevitable – the passage of the body – but instead to understand the permanence of the soul.

The Gita underscores the importance of understanding one's true nature as the immortal soul and recognizing the impermanence of the physical realm. By realizing the eternal nature of the self, one can attain liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death. This liberation is achieved by transcending attachments to the material world, performing one's duties selflessly, and seeking a union with the divine (Yoga) through devotion, knowledge, or disciplined action.

The teachings of the Gita emphasize self-realization, guiding individuals to comprehend their divine essence and recognize the interconnectedness of all life. By acknowledging the immortal nature of the soul, individuals are encouraged to live a life of righteousness, duty, and spiritual awareness, transcending the temporary nature of worldly experiences.
In essence, the immortality of the soul as expounded in the Gita elucidates the eternal and unchanging essence within every being, urging one to seek a deeper understanding of the self, transcend transient experiences, and attain spiritual liberation.

A day earlier, Swamy had also remarked on PM Modi potentially travelling to Pakistan for the SCO meeting, describing it as an ""enemy country dominated by Punjabi Muslims who deny human rights to Baluchis, Sindhis, and Pathans"".

The former RS member had also commented on the PM's Ukraine visit on August 23, which marked a diplomatic engagement with the war-torn nation.
The visit has been described as a ""landmark and historic"" event, being the first by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine since the establishment of diplomatic relations over 30 years ago.
This visit came shortly after PM Modi’s trip to Moscow, where he subtly rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin over the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.
During the Moscow visit, PM Modi expressed his anguish over the loss of innocent lives, particularly children, in the conflict, urging both Russia and Ukraine to resolve their differences through dialogue and diplomacy.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/subramanian-swamy-comments-on-pm-modis-foreign-tours/articleshow/112947448.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Sports Desk,SPORTS,07.08.2024,"NEW DELHI: The Indian batting lineup struggled against the Sri Lankan spinners, led by Dunith Wellalage's five-wicket haul in the third and final ODI between India and Sri Lanka in Colombo.
Chasing a competitive target of 249 on a turning track, India were bowled out for a paltry 138 in 26.1 overs, handing Sri Lanka a comprehensive 110-run victory and their first bilateral ODI series win over India since 1997.

Despite a brisk start from Rohit Sharma, the Indian batters succumbed to the guile of the Sri Lankan spinners, with Wellalage and Maheesh Theekshana causing the most damage. Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, and debutant Riyan Parag all fell victim to the spin trap, as India's batting lineup crumbled under pressure.

Earlier, Sri Lanka posted a competitive total of 248/7, thanks to a well-paced 96 from opener Avishka Fernando and a solid contribution from Kusal Mendis (59). Fernando's innings laid the foundation for Sri Lanka, as he shared crucial partnerships with Pathum Nissanka (45) and Mendis.
AS IT HAPPENED: SL vs IND, 3rd ODI
India's bowling effort was led by debutant Riyan Parag, who picked up three wickets, while Kuldeep Yadav provided valuable support. However, the Sri Lankan batters managed to capitalize on the Indian bowlers' inconsistencies, with Mohammed Siraj proving expensive.


The series victory marked a significant achievement for Sri Lanka, as they had not won a bilateral ODI series against India since 1997. The result also highlighted the challenges faced by the Indian team on turning tracks, as acknowledged by Maheesh Theekshana in his post-match comments.

TOI,NEWS HOME,01.09.2024,"ISLAMABAD: The syndicate of the University of Karachi on Sunday cancelled the degree of a high court Judge at the Unfair Means Committee's recommendation, Dawn reported, quoting its university sources.
The announcement came after the alleged ""illegal detention"" of a syndicate member Raiz Ahmed by three police stations on Saturday, Dawn reported.
Ahmed said that he objected to an agenda which involved Islamabad high court judge Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri's degree which was issued 40 years ago, Dawn reported.

After Ahmed was allegedly kidnapped on Saturday- probably to prevent him from attending the meeting- the meeting went ahead without him and the syndicate decided to cancel the judge's degree, reported Dawn.

A statement by Karachi University, without naming anyone, said, ""The members also approved the recommendations of the KU UFM [unfair means] Committee which has proposed cancellation of the degree and enrolment cards of the candidate(s) who were found in unethical and immoral acts.""
The fracas started after an application sought information on Jahangiri's LLB degree under Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016. The application stated that candidate Jahangiri obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968.

But, one Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 bore the same enrolment number as Jahangiri, while while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name of Jahangiri. Jahangiri enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The university deemed the degree invalid, claiming that they issue only one enrolment number per degree programme, making it impossible for a candidate to have multiple enrolment numbers, Dawn reported.
Jahangiri had earlier complained to the Supreme Judicial Council about the Chief Justice and said that the Inter-Services Intelligence interfered in judicial affairs. He also said that spy cameras were detected in the bedroom and entrance of a judge's house and the matter was reported to Chief Justice but no action was taken in response, Dawn stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-karachi-university-deems-high-court-judges-degree-invalid-after-40-years/articleshow/112966620.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,AUTO,29.08.2024,"India has lately seen a sharp increase in accidents involving unfit commercial vehicles, with nearly 40 percent of the 1.94 lakh road fatalities in FY 2022-23 attributed to such vehicles. A significant factor contributing to these deaths is the issuance of fraudulent fitness certificates to unfit vehicles. In response, Dr. Kamal Soi, Chairman of Raahat Foundation, has urged the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to overhaul the country's vehicle testing system.
He highlighted the importance of establishing automated testing stations, as outlined in the 2021 government notification, to address this critical issue.
Highlighting the gravity of the issue, the appeal read, “Unfit commercial vehicles have become a significant factor in road accidents, turning the vehicle fitness certification process into a multi-billion dollar corruption industry.”
To expose these practices, the foundation conducted a pilot study across several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, and Rajasthan, revealing widespread irregularities in the issuance of fitness certificates.

Commercial vehicle fitness certification: Study findings

Key findings from the study show that many unfit vehicles are being granted fitness certificates without proper inspection, with some testing centres issuing these certificates by merely taking pictures and feeding data manually into the system. The study also uncovered collusion between local RTO agents and testing centres, allowing unfit vehicles to operate on public roads, contributing significantly to road accidents and economic losses.

Despite MoRTH’s 2021 directive to establish Automated Testing Stations (G.S.R 652(E) dated 23.09.2021) to ensure the integrity of vehicle fitness evaluations, many states have failed to comply, allowing unauthorised testing centres to continue issuing fitness certificates under questionable circumstances.
The foundation is calling for MoRTH to direct all states and union territories to comply with the 2021 notification and establish Automated Testing Stations as mandated. Additionally, he recommends strict actions against non-compliant testing centres, including revoking their authorization.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/india-has-a-killer-commercial-vehicles-problem-led-to-more-than-70k-deaths/articleshow/112886082.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,SPEAKING TREE,27.12.2023,"The concept of mortality or death often instills fear and uncertainty in people. However, acknowledging the inevitability of death can spur personal growth. Understanding life's finite nature encourages authenticity, the pursuit of purpose and cherishing moments that we often seem to overlook. Cultivating spiritual beliefs, nurturing meaningful relationships and practicing mindfulness help in getting away from the fears associated with death.
However, it's important to understand this idea within the context of these belief systems:
Spiritual Transformation: Some philosophical and spiritual perspectives consider death as a transformative process.

They view life as a journey where death represents a transition to another state of existence or a path toward ultimate spiritual realization.
Release from Suffering: Certain belief systems perceive death as a liberation from the cycle of suffering or as a means to transcend the limitations of the physical realm. It's seen as a passage to a higher state of being or consciousness.

Transcending Ego and Attachments: Death is sometimes viewed as an opportunity to let go of attachments, desires, and the ego, paving the way for spiritual growth and enlightenment. By confronting the impermanence of life, individuals might seek deeper truths and a more profound understanding of existence.
Mortality as a Teacher: Contemplating mortality can serve as a reminder of life's impermanence, encouraging individuals to live authentically, cherish each moment, and prioritize what truly matters. In this sense, death can guide individuals on a path towards personal growth and fulfillment.

However, this perspective on death as a path to perfection or enlightenment isn't universally accepted. Many belief systems emphasize the sanctity of life, the importance of compassion, and the pursuit of spiritual growth through living consciously rather than focusing on death as the means to an end.
It's essential to approach this concept with cultural sensitivity and recognize that beliefs surrounding death and spiritual evolution vary widely among different traditions and individuals. The idea of death leading to perfection or enlightenment is deeply rooted in certain philosophical and spiritual ideologies but may not resonate with everyone's beliefs or worldview.

Sullivan's first trip to China as national security adviser was aimed at keeping high-level communications open and stabilising bilateral relations to avoid conflict.

The White House statement said both sides would keep lines of communication open, including planning for a ""leader-level call"" in the coming weeks.
There was no indication the two leaders might meet in person before Biden leaves the Oval Office.

China has rapidly expanded its military, and there are concerns that Taiwan and the South China Sea are becoming flashpoints.
Wang told Sullivan that Taiwan's independence poses the greatest threat to stability in the immediate region. He demanded that the US ""stop arming the island but support China's peaceful unification,"" according to a statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy that split from authoritarian communist China in 1949, has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification with the mainland by peace or by force. The US is obligated under a domestic law to provide the island with sufficient hardware and technology to deter invasion.

The White House statement said Sullivan ""underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"".
Sullivan planned to meet with China's Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Zhang Youxia on Thursday morning, according to a senior Biden administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be publicly announced meeting.
Zhang has spoken in the past of Beijing's determination to take control of Taiwan. At an international naval gathering earlier this year in northeast China, Zhang said China would strike back with force if its interests came under threat.
He said China's territorial sovereignty ""brooks no infringement and its core interests cannot be challenged. We do not provoke trouble, but we will never flinch in face of provocation. The Chinese military will resolutely defend the reunification and interest of the motherland"".
Beijing also warned Washington ""not to support or indulge the Philippines to infringe"" upon China's rights and interests in the South China Sea. China and the Philippines have clashed over the Second Thomas Shoal and lately the Sabina Shoal.
The US military has pushed back against China's claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, saying this week it would be open to consultations about escorting Philippine ships in the disputed sea amid a spike in hostilities between Beijing and Manila on the issue.
The White House said Sullivan reaffirmed the US commitment to defending its Indo-Pacific allies and expressed concern about Beijing's destabilizing actions against ""lawful Philippine maritime operations"" in the South China Sea.
The Philippines has called for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to do more. The 10-nation Southeast Asian bloc includes the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, which have South China Sea claims that overlap with each other as well as China's and Taiwan's.
The US has shifted its policy with China from engagement to competition. The Biden administration has made it a priority to prevent the competition from spiralling out of control, while seeking to collaborate with China in areas such as climate change, artificial intelligence and enforcement against illicit drugs.
John Podesta, the senior adviser to the president for international climate policy, will travel to China, and Sullivan and Wang discussed ""next steps to reduce the flow of illicit synthetic drugs"" and ""continue repatriation of undocumented migrants,"" the White House said.
The US Border Patrol in July made 1,851 arrests of Chinese immigrants on the border with Mexico, down from the December high of 5,951.
The two sides also agreed to hold a second round of dialogue over artificial intelligence, the Chinese foreign ministry said.
Sullivan raised continued concerns about China's trade policies and non-market economic practices, the White House said.
Wang demanded the US ""stop suppressing China in the areas of trade, economic and technology,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said.
By resorting to protectionism, the US would only ""hurt the global green development and affect the global economic growth,"" Wang told Sullivan.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-and-the-us-will-plan-a-biden-xi-call-in-the-coming-weeks-the-white-house-says/articleshow/112881361.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,BUSINESS,05.02.2024,"BENGALURU: A novel gene editing platform OmiCrisp, by Bengaluru-based startup CrisprBits, is monitoring sewage samples to track the highly transmissible JN.1 variant of Covid in the city.
OmiCrisp is a testing platform based on CRISPR, a breakthrough gene-editing technology, for rapid diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV2.
OmiCrisp is monitoring the Omicron-derived JN.1 variant in sewage samples from 14 localities in Bengaluru every week, the company said.

The CRISPR-based test not only detects the virus, but also distinguishes variants of Omicron lineage from other previously known variants of concern.

The technology can specifically discriminate the actual base changes as the virus mutates, instead of relying on the absence of signal due to sequence changes.
In the Journal of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, OmiCrisp was validated in 80 clinical samples and more than 160 wastewater samples with a remarkable 99 per cent accuracy, the company said.
The clinical samples were cross-validated against the highly accurate next-generation sequencing platform, while wastewater results were compared using approved qRTPCR tests.

""OmiCrisp validation is one of the first studies to employ CRISPR-based testing in environmental samples,"" said Vijay Chandru, an author on the study, Chief Scientific Officer and Co-Founder, CrisprBits, in a statement.
Notably, the CRISPR-based test demonstrated tolerance to poor-quality samples derived from sewage, highlighting its utility in discerning even single base changes in matrices of inferior stability.
Founded in 2020 by five distinguished alumni of BITS-Pilani, CrisprBits is a startup incubated by Bengaluru-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (C-CAMP). It aims to bring innovative solutions using the CRISPR technology.
""OmiCrisp is a CRISPR-based one-stop diagnostic and screening tool for Omicron variant and its lineages has shown a remarkable accuracy of up to 99 per cent in both clinical and sewage samples. This has enormous implications for India's pandemic preparedness for Covid and other infectious disease outbreaks,"" said Taslimarif Saiyed, Director CEO of C-CAMP, in the statement.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,04.03.2024,"Artificial Intelligence can play a key role in furthering the objective of targeted financial literacy, feels Anita Shah Akella, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, and CEO-IEPFA (Investor Education And Protection Fund Authority). Anita Shah Akella on Monday spoke at The Times of India Right To Excellence Financial Literacy Summit in a fireside chat on the topic of “AI-Powered Financial Literacy: Leveraging Technology for Inclusive Growth”.

Anita Shah Akella discussed in detail how she sees Artificial Intelligence (AI) powering inclusiveness with regards to financial literacy. “AI should be able to help me make tailored specific programmes. It could be for women who are working, housewives, underprivileged,” she said. “For instance, we've just started a theme called Niveshak Pehal, where we are educating the drivers, maids of various RWAs. In order to get information for that initiative, where we should target, AI will be helping us,” she said.
Anita Shah Akella said that AI will be used to help people make more informed choices on where to invest their savings; educate them on various investment avenues that are available whether a bank account, stocks etc.
Going ahead, AI could be tailored in a way to filter out risky investments or probably also indicate what could be the more safer investment depending upon the risk profile, she says.

We take the verification from the company, and then we return the shares as well as the dividend amount to them,” she said.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,27.03.2024,"Updating EPF account KYC online: The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.
The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme.
This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).
The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.
Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.

It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:

Pre-requisites
Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.
Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.
How to update KYC online

Step 1: Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.
Step 2: Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""
Step 3: Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""
Step 4: Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.
Successful submission
After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.
Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/retirement-planning/now-update-kyc-details-for-your-epf-account-online-detailed-guide-to-new-provident-fund-process/articleshow/108805392.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,29.06.2024,"Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24: If your income is below Rs 7 lakh, then you may be wondering if you need to file your Income Tax Return. The first important point to note is that filing ITR is very different from paying income tax. Filing an income tax return (ITR) is compulsory if your gross taxable income surpasses the basic exemption limit or if you have carried out specific transactions.
However, this does not always imply that you are required to pay income tax.
The deadline for filing ITR for the current assessment year is July 31, 2024, for individuals who are not required to undergo an income tax audit for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Apart from income, there are additional factors that make filing ITR mandatory.
Under section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, you are eligible for a tax rebate if your net taxable income is within Rs 5 lakh (old tax regime) or Rs 7 lakh (new tax regime).
The maximum tax rebate available is Rs 12,500 under the old tax regime and Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime. As a result, if your income falls within the specified levels, you are not obligated to pay any income tax. Nevertheless, even if your tax liability becomes zero due to the tax rebate, filing an ITR is still necessary, according to an ET report.

""Generally, taxpayers have a mis-understanding that if tax is not payable then filing of ITR is also not mandatory,"" says Sudhir Kaushik, Co-founder and CEO, Taxspanner.com was quoted as saying.
According to Kaushik, filing ITR is obligatory if your gross total income, before deductions under Chapter VI (Sections 80C, 80D, etc.), is more than the basic exemption limit.
Also Check | ITR e-Filing FY 2023-24: Which Is The Correct Income Tax Return Form For You? From ITR-1 To ITR-7 - Check Here
For FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), the basic exemption limits under the old tax regime are:

* Rs 2.5 lakh for individuals below 60 years of age
* Rs 3.0 lakh for individuals above 60 years but below 80 years of age
* Rs 5.0 lakh for individuals above 80 years of age
Under the new tax regime, the basic exemption limit for all categories of taxpayers is Rs 3 lakh for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25).
When is ITR filing mandatory irrespective of income level?

According to Neeraj Agarwala, Partner at Nangia Andersen India, there are certain situations where individuals must file an ITR regardless of their gross total income:
* If an individual's annual bank deposits in one or more savings accounts surpass Rs 50 lakh, they are obligated to file an ITR.
* Individuals whose electricity bill exceeds Rs 1 lakh during the year must file an ITR.
* Those who own assets in a foreign country, are beneficiaries of such assets, or have signing authority in any overseas account must file an ITR.
* Professionals earning more than Rs 10 lakh during a financial year are required to file an ITR.
* If a person's TDS/TCS is more than Rs 25,000 (or Rs 50,000 for senior citizens), filing an ITR is compulsory.
* Individuals who spend Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel for themselves or others during the financial year are required to file an ITR.
Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: Why is Form 16 important for salaried individuals when filing income tax return?
To better understand these requirements, consider the following examples:
* Example 1: Consider a salaried individual with a gross taxable income of Rs 5.5 lakh, eligible for a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, 80C deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, and other deductions totaling Rs 1,10,000, you need to file ITR.
* Example 2: If your net taxable income is Rs 4.25 lakh, which is below the Rs 5 lakh or Rs 7 lakh threshold (depending on the tax regime), you are exempt from paying income tax due to the rebate under section 87A. However, you must still file an ITR because your gross total income exceeds Rs 2.5 lakh (old tax regime) or Rs 3 lakh (new tax regime).
* Example 3: As a salaried individual with a gross taxable income of Rs 7.5 lakh and a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, you may not owe any income tax after deductions and rebates. Nevertheless, filing an ITR is still mandatory.
Agarwala states, ""Individuals are mandatorily required to file an income tax return if their total income, excluding deductions under Chapter VI-A, exceeds the basic exemption limit. In this case, the total income excluding gross deductions under section 80C will be Rs 3,90,000 (Rs 5.5 lakh-Rs 50,000-Rs 1.1 lakh) (assuming the other deductions are not under Chapter VI-A), and they will be mandatorily required to file their ITR.""

What are the consequences of not filing ITR, even if you are mandated to?

If you are obligated to file an ITR but fail to do so by the deadline of July 31, 2024, you have the option to file a belated ITR. However, if you choose not to file at all, you may face several consequences, says Agarwala.
Firstly, under Section 234A, if you don't pay your taxes on time, you will be subject to penal interest at a rate of 1% per month on the outstanding tax amount. Additionally, if there is a delay in the payment of advance tax, interest will be levied under Section 234B.
Moreover, according to Section 234F, failing to file your ITR within the due date will result in a late fee of Rs 5,000. However, if your annual income is below Rs 5 lakhs, the late fee will be limited to Rs 1,000. If your gross income falls below the basic exemption limit, no penalty will be charged.
It's important to note that when filing a belated ITR, you forfeit the ability to carry forward losses from stocks, future and options (F&O), and other sources. However, you can still carry forward losses from house property.
Furthermore, filing an ITR is a prerequisite for receiving any tax refund. If you file a belated ITR, you will not be entitled to any interest on the tax refund.
In the event that you don't file an ITR, the income tax assessing officer has the authority to conduct a Best Judgment Assessment. This means that the tax officer may estimate your income and tax liability based on the information available to them.
Lastly, if you fail to file your ITR and do not opt for the old tax regime by submitting Form 10-IEA, your income tax will be calculated under the new tax regime by default. As a result, you may miss out on claiming gross deductions that would have been applicable to you.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/income-tax-return-filing-is-it-compulsory-to-file-itr-if-income-does-not-exceed-rs-7-lakh/articleshow/111366661.cms,,,,,,,,,

Basically one becomes happy when one is secure and is at peace with oneself. This sense of security comes from becoming spiritual.
Spirituality is concerned with matters of spirit. When we think deeply and for a long time about anything whether it is an idea or an object then the brain has a tendency of focusing on it like a laser and in that process the object vanishes from the vision field and only its germ or the spirit remains. It is this deep thinking on anything which makes us spiritual; reduces our greed; provides internal security and gives us a sense of peace and happiness.

This helps us focus on bigger and better things, reduces anxiety and stress levels and creates positive outlook towards life.

Creating better environment is what I call nation building. It is the enabling environment which makes us feel happy to live in, work in and just be a part of it. This environmental happiness also gives us a sense of belonging, makes us feel proud of our surroundings and gives us a sense of ownership.
If we create a happy and pleasant environment for our work and living, then we will make India a great place to live. Each one of us should therefore work towards improving our immediate environment so that it becomes nice and cheerful. Then we will be genuinely proud to be a part of it which is the India of my dreams.
India is endowed with plenty of land, good weather, intelligent and hardworking people. What is lacking is leadership to guide and inspire the citizens to work for higher cause. This is what Mahatma Gandhi did during his war for independence. Working for independence based upon the noble path of non-violence was the cause which united Indians to work selflessly.
Each one of us therefore have a duty to educate children and young students regarding ethics, sustainability, and spirituality.
Thus I feel that when all of us work for higher cause of creating happiness and well-being rather than dividing the country by fear then we will unleash the creative force of Indians and help make India a great and pleasant country to live and work in. That is the India of my dreams.

TOI,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud on Sunday said district courts working with 30% vacancy in judicial officers had achieved 95% disposal rate and said to tackle the monstrous backlog of 4.5 crore cases, time had come to think of implementing All India Judicial Services (AIJS) for quick filling of vacancies for expeditious disposal of cases and reducing pendency.

Do you think postponing the release of Kangana Ranaut's film 'Emergency' is justified?
No
Yes

Speaking at valedictory ceremony of the two-day national conference of district judiciary to mark 75 years of SC, the CJI said, ""Our current national average disposal rate stands at 95%.""
""Despite progress, tackling pending cases remains a challenge. Increasing our disposal-to-filing ratio hinges on attracting skilled personnel. At district level, vacancies in judicial personnel stand at 28% and of non-judicial staff at 27%. For disposal to outweigh the institution of cases, courts must work beyond the capacity of 71-100%.""
""Time has come to think of national integration by recruiting members to judicial services across narrow walls of regionalism and state-centred selections,"" he added. Centre's AIJS, proposed in 2015, had virtually no takers, as only Haryana and Mizoram govts and HCs of Tripura and Sikkim had favoured it. Others opposed it on grounds of linguistic barrier and federalism.

The CJI said though women were outnumbering men in recent recruitments of judicial officers across states, sadly only 6.7% district court infrastructure are female friendly. ""Is this acceptable in a nation where basic level of recruitment in some states sees over 60-70% women joining?"" he asked & said judiciary's focus areas were on increasing accessibility measures which could be understood by carrying out infrastructure audits, opening medical facilities and creches in court and technological projects.

""Inclusivity in judiciary is a reflection of our broader commitment to equality and justice. Some key measures are developing a comprehensive framework for gender equality in decision making; adopting measures to recruit, retain and promote members from diverse and vulnerable groups; and monitoring impact of gender equality initiatives,"" he said.
He said panel on reducing arrears of cases had devised an action plan for reducing pendency through case management. Stages of tackling pendency are - preparatory stage of forming district level case management committees to identify target cases, undated cases, and reconstruction of records; resolve cases which have been pending for 10-20 years, 20-30 years and over 30 years.

The answer is as follows. A new electronic system should be setup where there is a virtual court room.
The entire video call is already pre-recorded and will be automatically transcribed so there is no need
for a transcriptionist.
All papers are pre-scanned and entered into a digital evidence locker.
The judge is not seen during the court proceedings and the judge's information is not available. Only an
anonymous ID. There are no procedural delays, on the date, the participants have to bring all their
evidence which is shared in advance between either the prosecution and the defense so that both parties
know what the other party will say.
All witnesses attend by virtual video call.
When the lawyer is giving their statements they can reference the items in the digital evidence locker.
They have a pointer and drawing tool where they can circle particular parts of the evidence of rotate it
around.
Based on this, you can certify judges to take cases. Judges are paid on a per case basis.
The cost of the case for the judges fees are borne by the loser in the case of civil trial and by the case
of the convict in the case of criminal trial. Only the cases where the convict walks free is paid for by
the state. In those cases, the prosecution gets only 50% of their fee.
Since the judge has no clue which case they will see that day, and has no interaction with the accused or
the prosecution. This reduces the scope for bribery. Since the judge is anonymous and doesn't have the
contact information of the accused or the prosecution.
Since judges are paid on a per case basis, they have an incentive to finish cases every day.
At the end of the case, the judge fills out an automated questionnaire, where the software will already
consult precedents, and recommend the correct sentencing guidelines. The judge can give the higher or lower
sentence within the guidelines.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,17.06.2024,"SIP route to become a crorepati? Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), often seen as the mutual fund equivalent of putting your money in recurring deposits offered by banks, are a great way for retail investors to invest in equity mutual fund schemes. To maximize the benefits of this investment method, investors can consider opting for a SIP top-up, which allows them to increase the SIP amount annually.
According to an ET report, a study conducted by WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund reveals that a SIP top-up can significantly enhance the absolute returns from equity products.

WhiteOak Capital Mutual Fund says that a SIP top-up helps you extend that discipline to your expected higher future surplus money as well.
Financial planners emphasize that one of the most significant advantages of a SIP top-up is that it enables investors to achieve their financial goals more quickly.

Mutual fund investors can choose between a fixed amount top-up, where they add a specific amount like Rs 100 or Rs 1,000 to their base SIP every year, or a variable amount top-up, which can be a percentage (e.g., 10% or 15%) of their original SIP amount.
For instance, an investor who invests Rs 10,000 per month in the BSE Sensex TRI (Total Returns Index) for 25 years would accumulate Rs 2.71 crore. However, by adding an annual top-up of Rs 1,000 to the monthly SIP of Rs 10,000, the investment would grow to Rs 4.26 crore.

Small sums over time for a huge corpus

Furthermore, an annual top-up of 10% on the same SIP of Rs 10,000 would result in a substantial sum of Rs 5.52 crore.

The incident involved a group of miscreants who attempted to assault Singh and chanted slogans as he was leaving the venue.
Begusarai Superintendent of Police Manish said that the individual arrested was identified as Shahzad alias Saifi.

SP Manish said, ""One person has been arrested. The Union minister (Giriraj Singh) had a program in the Ballia subdivision this afternoon, during which a person behaved indecently. The policemen present in the security cordon caught him and further action is underway.""
The accused, who was beaten by Giriraj Singh's supporters before being handed over to the police, had attended the MP's 'Janta Darbar' program with a petition.

""The bearded person dressed like a Moulvi came to me with a petition and asked me to look into it. I told him that the Janta Darbar is over and he should have come on time. He then started shouting slogans against me. At one point of time, it appeared that he would physically attack me,"" Singh said.
Union minister Giriraj Singh, who also serves as the minister of textiles and BJP MP from Begusarai, condemned the attack and expressed his determination to continue his work. ""I am Giriraj and I will always speak and fight for the interests of the society. I am not going to be scared by these attacks. Those who pamper and caress them on seeing their beard and cap should see today how land jihad, love jihad and communal tension is being created in the entire country including Begusarai, Bihar,"" Giriraj Singh stated in a post on X.

He speculated about the potential severity of the attack, claiming that the assailant could have been armed. ""If this man had a revolver in his hand, he would have killed me the way he attacked me.
However, his attack failed. He used very abusive language,"" Singh said, echoing Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's remark, ""Batenge to Katenge.""
Speaking to ANI, Singh accused the local Muslim community's involvement in the incident, ""In this election, the attitude of Muslims towards me in Begusarai and the results that came, Yogi Adityanath rightly said that, 'Batenge to Katenge'. If this man had a revolver in his hand, he would have killed me the way he attacked me. However, his attack failed. He used very abusive language.""
He further emphasised his resolve, saying, ""I will not get afraid and will continue my work.

More than 70 people were killed in the attacks, where militants seeking the region's secession have been targeting govt forces and projects being developed as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The $200-million airport in Gwadar, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman and China, is close to completion. The initial plan was for PM Shehbaz Sharif to inaugurate it on Aug 14 alongside Chinese officials, but that was called off after an ethnic Baloch rights group started a sit-in protest, the officials said. Following the attacks, two officials at CAA and two others in the provincial govt said the start of flights would be delayed as authorities review security in the region.
Pakistan's military, meanwhile, said it had killed five insurgents and wounded three others in intelligence-based operations launched in the province in response to the attacks.

TOI,SPEAKING TREE,30.08.2024,"The idea of one God is professed in the Bhagwad Gita. Krishn says, 4.11, ""Ye yatha mam prapadyante, tan tathaiva bhajami aham,"" which means, ""By whatsoever way men seek me, I accept them the same way."" Thus, there is one God, who appears to us in the form that we seek Him. It applies to all human beings in any part of this universe. In the Gita, He appears in both ways - nirakar, formless and sakar, with form.

The Ishwar who created this vast creation, can also assume a form, simultaneously at many places. He can express himself in many forms and in many numbers. The raas lila of Krishn is an example of this. While dancing with gopis, he is with every one of them at the same time.
Krishn says in the Gita, ""All beings are equal to me."" ""I am the same to all beings. There is none whom I hate nor is anyone dear to me. However, those who worship me, in devotion, abide in me and I also remain in them.""
All deities are forms of that one God. The devotees who worship different deities for some material gain or for curing their suffering are also his worshippers. Krishn says there are four types of his devotees. The first is 'arta', a devotee who worships for the sake of removal of suffering. The second, called artharthi, worships for acquiring material possessions. A seeker of knowledge is the third kind, called jijnasu. The last one is a man of wisdom, who identifies with him with exclusive devotion.
The rewards made available to such devotees by the other gods and goddesses are bestowed by the Supreme Being only, ultimately. So, the different forms of different deities are also manifestations of the One, absolute, omnipotent, all-pervading God.

Shri Krishn emphasises his supremacy, ""Mattah parataram nanyat kinchid-asti dhananjaya; mayi sarvamidam protam, sootre manigana iva."" The verse implies, ""There is nothing higher than me, O Arjun. All glorious beings and things are woven in me; just as precious stones are strung upon a single thread."" Here too one God, the string, holds together numerous divine manifestations, precious stones.
At several places in the Gita, Krishn declares that God resides in the hearts of all. That is yet another pointer to one God pervading the entire universe. The vishwa-rupa, cosmic form that Krishn shows, as described in the 11th chapter of the Gita, is another splendid display of all divine expressions being included in the one God. The one appears as many.

The 10th chapter, vibhooti yoga, of the Gita talks of God being the basis of everything in the entire universe that shines with extraordinary charm and power. ""Please understand,"" says Krishn, 10.41, ""That anything or anybody in this vast universe, endowed with the most impressive qualities or glory, has arisen from a part of my effulgence.""
Thus, there are numerous pointers in the Gita to the overarching truth that God is one, and his expressions are many.

TOI News Desk,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of information and broadcasting on Monday summoned the Netflix India content head over the 'IC-814 -- The Kandahar Hijack' web series, which sparked controversy due to the depiction of hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi.
The BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya accused the filmmaker Anubhav Sinha for legitimizing the criminal intent of the hijackers by using their non-Muslim identities.

Malviya expressed concern that decades later, people might believe that Hindus were responsible for the hijacking of IC-814. He accused the Left of having an agenda to whitewash the crimes of Pakistani terrorists, who are all Muslims, and claimed that this has been a long-standing practice in the film industry.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,23.03.2024,"If diversification is your goal, then it is important to avoid overlaps in your mutual funds investment portfolio to the maximum extent possible. Many investors unknowingly invest in multiple equity schemes without realizing that their portfolios may have significant overlaps, which defeats the purpose of diversification. While it's challenging to completely eliminate overlaps, there are strategies to reduce their occurrence and achieve diversification goals.
An equity mutual fund scheme allocates its investments across a range of stocks according to regulatory directives.
For instance, a large-cap fund must allocate a minimum of 80% of its portfolio to stocks ranked 1-100 by market capitalization, while a mid-cap fund is required to invest at least 65% in stocks ranked 101-250 by market capitalization.
Some investors might spread their investments across two or three large-cap funds from different fund houses, believing they are diversifying their portfolios. However, in reality, a significant portion of their investments may overlap, with many funds holding similar sets of underlying stocks such as large banks, IT companies, and diversified conglomerates. This phenomenon is known as portfolio overlap.
In equity mutual funds, portfolio overlap refers to the situation where different funds hold the same stocks, leading to a concentration of investments. For instance, investing in multiple large-cap funds from different companies may result in a significant portion of the funds being allocated to the same set of stocks like large banks and IT companies, creating portfolio overlap.

Portfolio overlap in mutual funds occurs due to regulatory guidelines set by Sebi, which dictate where funds can invest based on market capitalization rankings. This limitation in investment options often leads to overlaps between funds. Moreover, portfolio overlap can also happen if investors choose funds from the same asset management company, as each AMC has a unique approach to building portfolios.
To mitigate portfolio overlap, investors should aim to diversify their investments across various fund categories. By spreading investments across different categories such as large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and sectoral funds, the likelihood of overlap decreases as the stock universe expands. Another effective strategy to reduce portfolio overlap is to invest in funds managed by different AMCs, as each AMC follows a distinct investment style.
This approach not only helps in minimizing overlap but also enhances portfolio diversification. Overall, while complete elimination of portfolio overlap may not be feasible, investors can take proactive steps to manage and reduce it to achieve better diversification outcomes.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/what-does-portfolio-overlap-in-mutual-funds-mean-tips-to-avoid-it/articleshow/108735167.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,22.03.2024,"Flexi-cap funds explained: If you are looking for flexibility for your fund manager to allocate money across large caps, mid caps and small caps, then flexi funds may be the way to go. But, let’s first understand what flexi cap funds are:
With a surge in new investors showing interest in mutual funds as stock markets reach record highs, financial planners are recommending flexi cap funds as a suitable starting point.

Flexi cap funds offer the flexibility to invest in companies of varying market capitalizations, including large-, mid-, or small-cap, without any constraints. Flexi cap funds are categorized as open-ended, dynamic equity mutual fund schemes, allowing fund managers the liberty to invest across companies of all market capitalizations without limitations.
Unlike other fund categories that have fixed allocation requirements, flexi cap funds mandate a minimum of 65% investment in equity and equity-related instruments. Financial advisors advocate for flexi cap funds due to the freedom they provide to fund managers in company allocation, in contrast to the restricted mandates of large cap, mid cap, small cap, and multi cap funds.

Schemes focusing on large cap, mid cap, small cap, and multi cap have predetermined mandates, compelling them to adhere to specific categories of companies within their portfolio.
For instance, a large cap fund is mandated to invest a minimum of 80% in companies ranked 1 to 100 by market capitalization, while a mid-cap fund must allocate at least 65% of its portfolio to companies ranked 101-250 by market capitalization. This structure aids numerous investors who frequently grapple with decisions regarding whether to choose large cap, mid cap, small cap, multi cap, or sectoral funds.

Flexi cap funds are recommended for long-term or first-time investors seeking a hassle-free approach to Indian equities without the need for individual stock selection. Investors aiming to diversify their portfolio with exposure to top companies regardless of market capitalization, to mitigate risk and volatility, and achieve long-term wealth accumulation, can benefit from flexi cap funds.

He was hoping to fly to Florida.
As he went on to smash the computers, he was screaming sending the bystanders in a moment of shock though they did not forget to capture the moment. Other passengers minded their own business and did not come in the way of the irate passenger. Authorities said he caused damage of $20,000.

While the flier who could not fly had his reasons to throw a fit, social media users asked whether he just happened to have walked into the airport with a hammer in his suitcase. Others wondered what the security personnel were doing and how the man was allowed to go on this rampage.

TOI Tech Desk,TECHNOLOGY,02.09.2024,"Netflix India recently released its new web series based on the Kandhar plane hijack. Titled 'IC814-The Kandahar Hijack,' the series recounts the experiences of hundreds of passengers aboard the flight. However, the web series is now trending online attracting a lot of attention.
Why the Netflix series is trending online
The Netflix web series 'IC814-The Kandahar Hijack' has faced criticism over the use of Hindu names for terrorists.
The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has summoned the head of Netflix content in response to the controversy. The government is seeking clarification regarding the contentious aspects of the OTT series.
The web series, directed by Anubhav Sinha, faced criticism from the BJP-led central government for using Hindu names, 'Bhola' and 'Shankar,' for two terrorists.

Amit Malviya, head of the BJP IT Cell, claimed that the hijackers of IC-814 were notorious terrorists who adopted aliases to conceal their Muslim identities.
“The hijackers of IC-814 were dreaded terrorists, who acquired aliases to hide their Muslim identities. Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha, legitimised their criminal intent, by furthering their non-Muslim names. Result? Decades later, people will think Hindus hijacked IC-814,” posted Malviya on X.

“Left’s agenda to whitewash the crimes of Pakistani terrorists, all Muslims, served. This is the power of cinema, which the Communists have been using aggressively, since the 70s. Perhaps even earlier. This will not just weaken / put in question India’s security apparatus in the long run, but also shift the blame away from the religious cohort that is responsible for all the bloodshed,” added Malviya.
What users said online about this controversy
The controversy sparked a heated online debate, with Anubhav Sinha being accused of misrepresenting facts and inciting religious feelings. Many users posted on X about the controversy surrounding the Netflix web series. Here are some of the reactions:
‘Names of IC814 Hijackers changed to Shankar & Bhola by @anubhavsinha This is how Bollywood let the TERRORISTS WIN: #BoycottBollywood #IC814TheKandaharHijack’

‘ये बॉलीवुड हमेशा हिंदू धर्म का मजाक बनाता है #BoycottBollywood’

‘Now people will understand that Rishabh Shetty wasn't wrong.’

‘IC 814 Terrorists names - Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar. In Movie - Shankar & Bhola! As long as we have people like @anubhavsinha, even Osama bin Laden will also win the Nobel Peace’

TOI,NEWS HOME,31.08.2024,"ISLAMABAD: The start of operations at a Chinese-funded airport in Pakistan's Balochistan has been pushed back for a security review after last week's attacks by separatists in the area, govt and aviation sources said. More than 70 people were killed in the attacks, where militants seeking the region's secession have been targeting govt forces and projects being developed as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The $200-million airport in Gwadar, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman and China, is close to completion. The initial plan was for PM Shehbaz Sharif to inaugurate it on Aug 14 alongside Chinese officials, but that was called off after an ethnic Baloch rights group started a sit-in protest, the officials said. Following the attacks, two officials at CAA and two others in the provincial govt said the start of flights would be delayed as authorities review security in the region.

The corporate affairs ministry is exploring a quicker method to transfer shares, dividends, and matured debentures to beneficiaries in inactive accounts that have not been claimed for years, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Such securities, dividends, and debentures that are not claimed for over seven years are transferred by companies to the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA) under the ministry.

According to an ET report by Banikinkar Pattanayak, the ministry is planning to enable the companies concerned to settle such claims after following the due processes and obtaining the IEPFA approval.

The authority will continue to hold the shares and debentures. If requested by companies, it will transfer the unclaimed papers to them for refund to the rightful claimants. The companies will be instructed to transfer the items within 15 days, according to the individual.
Currently, the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority issues refunds to the beneficiaries after the respective company suggests the transfer, following the verification of numerous documents related to the claims, claimants, or their legal heirs.

""As per the latest proposal, the ultimate responsibility of the transfer will lie with the companies concerned,"" said the person. ""They will do due diligence, verify documents, ascertain the genuineness of claims and claimants, and release the shares after the authority transfers these to them. Furthermore, they will be responsible for any mistakes.
The authority will closely monitor the settlement process.
In the financial year 2023-24, the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority refunded 10.58 million shares to investors, compared to 7.65 million shares in the previous year. In March, the ministry requested feedback from stakeholders on the draft rules regarding the refund process.

The ministry is also considering a proposal to simplify the process for claimants by reducing unnecessary paperwork.
Currently, refunds require about twenty-four documents to be scrutinized multiple times at various levels. As a result, the process is delayed, and the settlement frequently exceeds a year, instead of the intended 60 days.
The ministry is also planning to allow those claimants to express their complaints through video conferences organized by it occasionally.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,30.04.2024,"Latest NPS charges: The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has issued a new set of guidelines that define the fee structure for the National Pension Scheme (NPS) PoPs. These guidelines impact the fees charged by the ""Points of Presence"" (PoPs), which are entities authorised to provide NPS-related services to the public. As per an ET report, these services include helping individuals open and manage their NPS accounts.
Below are the key updates that NPS subscribers should be aware of.

According to the master circular dated April 25, 2024, a ""persistency charge"" will apply to accounts in the National Pension Scheme's All Citizen Model if the subscriber stays with a Point of Presence (PoP) for more than six months in a financial year. This fee will be charged once a year to the relevant PoPs by deducting units from the subscriber's NPS account after the financial year ends.

New security measures in NPS

In a circular dated April 1, 2024, the PFRDA announced an upgrade to the security of the NPS. They introduced a new layer of security based on Aadhaar, using two-factor authentication. This security measure is mandatory for all users with password-based access to the Central Recordkeeping Agency (CRA) system, starting from April 1, 2024.
PFRDA also mentioned that government nodal offices can use Aadhaar One-Time Password (OTP) for two-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. In a circular dated March 15, 2024, PFRDA outlined the process for Aadhaar mapping. The oversight office (PrAO/DTA) must first connect Aadhaar with the CRA User ID. Similarly, PAO/DTOs must link their Aadhaar to their CRA User ID for DDOs to start the Aadhaar linking process.
Safety practices for government nodal offices

On March 27, 2024, the PFRDA released a new circular titled 'Digital Safety Practices for Government Nodal Offices Under NPS Architecture Advisory, 2024'. This circular requires that when government nodal offices digitize and upload documents onto the Central Recordkeeping Agency (CRA) system, they must verify the information from the Subscriber Registration form and supporting Know Your Customer (KYC) details with official valid documents (OVDs) and the employee's service records.
In the same circular, the PFRDA updated the process for exiting or withdrawing from the NPS. According to the new guidelines, when processing an exit or withdrawal request on the CRA system, the information given by the subscriber or claimant must be checked against supporting documents and the employee's service records. This verification step is important to ensure that all details are accurate before the request is approved.
However, the PFRDA stated that users must follow the instructions of the CRA system without deviation when processing exit, withdrawal, or claim requests. Additionally, proper due diligence, certification, and digital authentication (such as Aadhaar authentication) must be completed before submitting or approving any requests in the CRA system.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/retirement-planning/important-updates-for-nps-subscribers-new-charges-and-security-measures-announced-by-pfrda/articleshow/109718509.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,AUTO,24.08.2024,"The TVS Jupiter has long been one of the standouts in the Indian scooter market, becoming a top-seller for TVS since its debut in 2013. Originally launched as a 110 cc model, the lineup expanded with a 125 cc version, leading to a cumulative sales figure of over 65 lakh units. In 2021 alone, the Jupiter brand accounted for a whopping 86 percent of TVS's scooter sales.
Despite its success, Jupiter hadn't seen a major generational update—until now.
Enter the 2024 TVS Jupiter - in its fresh skin and bones almost after 11 years of launch. We had the chance to take it for a spin at TVS’s testing track in Hosur, covering just over 20 kilometres. Although the near-perfect track conditions didn't fully replicate real-world scenarios, we got a solid first impression of how this latest iteration is likely to perform on the streets.

The 2024 TVS Jupiter has had a serious glow-up in the design department. At first glance, it’s clear that this isn’t just the same old scooter with a few tweaks; it’s taken a leap towards a sportier and more youthful vibe. Up front, you’ve got a sleek LED DRL with integrated turn indicators, giving it a major upgrade over its predecessors.

Besides that, the sides now feature dynamic lines that make it look lively and full of energy - unlike the flat, basic profile of the previous model. At the rear, there’s a sleek LED light bar with integrated turn signals and emergency braking lights. With these fresh design elements, it would be safe to say that the new Jupiter isn’t just keeping up with the evolving family scooter market—it’s standing out in a big way. In our opinion, the 2024 Jupiter is one of the most handsome family scooters in India presently.

2024 TVS Jupiter: Features

Besides the cosmetic upgrades, the company has now also equipped the new Jupiter with modern tech. Starting from the front, the LED headlamp now gets a follow-me function borrowed from its bigger sibling. The instrument cluster, on the other hand, is now a neat, digital unit with a host of indicators including speedometer, trip meter, time, fuel, economy and more if connected to the SmartXConnect app. Unfortunately, we couldn't put the connectivity features to the test during our quick spin. However, the instrument cluster deserves a shout-out. It’s well-lit and everything’s laid out in a way that’s easy on the eyes. The graphics are clean and the info is neatly separated, so you can grab what you need at a glance without losing focus on the road.

Besides these, you also get a USB charger, a roomy glove box, a 33-litre storage space under the seat - courtesy of the fuel tank that has now been integrated under the floorboard. It also gets a long, flat seat that the company says is the biggest in its class. When you add all of this together, what you get is a feature-packed, practical family scooter without having to burn a hole in your pockets.

TVS Jupiter 2024 - Riding comfort, ergonomics and performance

Now, coming to the ride quality bit, the Jupiter has always been an agile, easy-to-maneuver scooter and the 2024 iteration of the model is no different. In fact, it’s better. Before we talk about the ride quality, here is what it offers on papers. It is powered by a new, refined 113.3 cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that’s rated for 7.91 hp and 9.2 Nm of torque. However, with the newly-introduced iGo assist, the peak torque output can reach up to 9.8 Nm. The iGo assist not only saves fuel by shutting off the engine when you’re stopped for a bit, like at red lights; but also kicks in with extra torque when you give it full throttle, which is awesome for zipping past traffic. That said, it won’t make you feel like a superhero but yes, you will experience a noticeable zip!

When it comes to ergonomics and comfort, the new Jupiter continues to deliver. The riding posture is nicely upright, and the seat is designed for a relaxed position with great support for your thighs. You’ll stay comfortable on long city rides, with no strain on your shoulders or lower back.

Now, onto the ride — the new Jupiter really impresses here. It’s quick off the line and offers smooth, linear acceleration up to 53-55 kmph. We didn’t notice much vibration until we hit 73 kmph; beyond that, there’s a bit of buzz, but it’s mostly confined to the bottom of the scooter. That said, this scooter, like it has always been, will be comfortable to cruise in the city at speeds up to 75 kmph without breaking a sweat. Moreover, it is impressively agile and nimble, and will be comfortable to make those quick maneuvers or escapes in panic situations. The suspension setup, with a telescopic fork up front and a preload-adjustable rear spring, keeps things stable and balanced, thus making the turns a lot more fun.

Braking duties in the new TVS Jupiter are handled by a 220 mm front disc, 130 mm rear drum setup on the higher-end variants. The sync brake system (SBS), as TVS calls it, delivers a confident braking experience. Even when you apply a single brake, the system even distributes the braking force to both wheels leading to a stable stop. In fact, it now also has an emergency braking light at the tail section which alerts the following vehicles in cases of panic braking situations.
TVS Jupiter 2024: Verdict


Overall, the updated Jupiter is a well-rounded package with its fresh styling, new features, and a host of updates here and there. It’s practical, user-friendly, and priced from Rs 73,700, ex-showroom. The model is available in four variants and seven colour options. If you’re after a scooter that looks great and covers all the essentials, this one should definitely be on your radar.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/reviews/2024-tvs-jupiter-110-first-ride-impressions-stylish-practical-but-good-performer/articleshow/112756536.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"NEW DELHI: Amid continuing outrage over the brutal rape-murder of a doctor at a govt run hospital in Kolkata and recent cases of sexual assault in other states, a new report that analysed National Crime Records Bureau data on cases of rape/gangrape followed by murder said 1,551 cases were reported under this category between 2017 and 2022.
The highest number of cases of rape/gangrape with murder at 294 were reported in 2018 and the lowest at 219 in 2020.
The number was 223 in 2017; 283 in 2019; 284 in 2021 and 248 in 2022. State-wise data for six years showed that UP reported the highest cases (280) followed by Madhya Pradesh (207), Assam (205), Maharashtra (155) and Karnataka (79).
The analysis, carried out by non-profit Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, highlighted that going by the total number of 1,551 cases, this works out to an annual average of a little more than 258 cases. ""In other words, on an average, almost five cases (4.9) of rape/gangrape with murder were reported every week between 2017-2022,"" the report said. The NCRB in its annual 'Crime In India' report began reporting statistics about rape/gangrape followed by murder as a separate category from 2017.
As far as outcomes go, out of the 308 cases in which trial was completed, a little less than two-thirds (65%) of cases (200) resulted in conviction. In more than a third of cases, the outcome was one of discharge (6%) or acquittal of the accused (28%). The rate of conviction was lowest in 2017 (57.89%) and highest in 2021 (75%). It was 69% in 2022.

NCRB's data showed that the number of rape/gangrape with murder cases before trial courts increased year on year during the period under study. The total number of cases - backlog plus new cases sent for trial - was at its lowest (574 cases) in 2017 and steadily increased to 1,333 by 2022 which is an increase of 132%.
CHRI director Venkatesh Nayak said, ""It is extremely worrisome that in a large number of cases, the police filed a final report instead of a chargesheet after the completion of investigation. As many as 140 cases of rape/gangrape with murder were closed with a final report during the six-year period with 97 of these closed due to insufficient evidence to try the accused for rape/gangrape with murder.""

NCRB captures this data with regard to cases where the police investigation was not able to unearth sufficient evidence to try the accused or where the accused remained untraced, or the complaint was found to be false or where the case ended as a mistake of fact or law or the issue was in the nature of civil dispute.
In four of the six years under study, the rate of chargesheeting was above 90% even during the pandemic years. The success rate dipped below 90% in 2018 (87%) and more recently in 2022 (85%). However, the findings also show that the police have not been able to complete investigation in 32-49% cases of rape/gangrape with murder during this period.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-rape-murder-cases-a-week-reported-during-17-22-study/articleshow/112974698.cms,,,,,,,,,

Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.
The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.

In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.
Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.
For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.

TOI,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"Experts at Seattle University discovered a new sexual orientation called ""symbiosexuality,"" which involves being attracted to the shared energy, multidimensionality, and power between people in relationships rather than to individuals themselves, challenging traditional understandings of human attraction and desire, reports The New York Post.
The study published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour reveals that symbiosexuals are attracted the love shared between two people and desire to be part of that relational energy, focusing on the ""whole"" relationship, which is considered ""greater than the sum of its parts.""
Dr Sally Johnston, the study's lead researcher, believes that human sexuality is more intricate than previously thought.
""We need to rethink the nature of human attraction and desire as only one-to-one experiences,"" said Dr Johnston.
Additionally, the study reveals that symbiosexuality is present across various demographics, including age, race, socio-economic status, and gender identity.

""Symbiosexuals are often stigmatised in both monogamous and non-monogamous communities,"" Johnston said to The New York Post.
The term ""unicorn"" has been used in literature to describe this attraction, but it has negative connotations in non-monogamous circles, referring to individuals who engage in sexual activity without being involved in other aspects of the relationship.
Johnston further admits that despite potential sexual benefits, the third party in such situations often faces mistreatment, objectification, and ostracism. However, she recognized a ""diverse population of people"" who experience symbiosexual attraction.

The study included 145 reports from participants expressing attraction to couples rather than to individual persons within the relationship. Johnston's research suggests that most self-identified symbiosexuals are extroverted, desire intimacy, care, and attention, and are less prone to jealousy.
""I hope that this work will reduce stigma in both monogamous and non-monogamous communities and expand conceptualizations of desire in sexuality studies,"" Johnston said.
Some participants who identify as queer and sexually open reported being primarily attracted to queer and non-heterosexual couples. Johnston intends to further investigate this evolving sexual identity, focusing on its implications for mental health and relationship satisfaction.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-symbiosexuality-all-you-need-to-know-about-phenomenon-of-being-attracted-to-established-couples/articleshow/112982325.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,27.08.2024,"Buying SGBs from the stock market: The government introduced Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) in 2015 as a safer alternative to physically holding gold. SGBs eliminate the risks and costs associated with storing physical gold while guaranteeing investors the market value of gold at maturity and monthly interest payments. The bonds are held in the RBI's records or in demat form, mitigating the risk of scrip loss and other related issues.
Investors can purchase Sovereign Gold Bonds from the primary market during the government-announced subscription periods or from the secondary market through the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

According to an ET report, if you fail to apply for SGBs during the primary issuance, you can still invest in them through the stock exchanges in the secondary market. The price of SGBs in the secondary market is determined by supply and demand, similar to other securities. Typically, SGBs trade at a discount to the spot price of gold, the ET report said.

To purchase SGBs through the stock market, follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify the discounted or high-yielding SGB on NSE or BSE.
Step 2: Locate the SGB scrip code in your demat account and place a buy order.
Step 3: The bonds will be credited to your demat account within one working day (T+1) of the transaction.

The tax treatment for exiting a gold bond investment varies depending on the method chosen. According to the report, the tax treatment differs if you exit your gold bond investment earlier.

There are two popular ways to exit a gold bond investment; the first is via the early redemption window at the end of 5 years, and the second is to sell your bonds in the secondary market. In both cases, capital gains will be taxable according to the usual definition of short-term and long-term capital gains. If it is the former, the rate applicable will be at its peak. If it is the latter, then the investor can choose between a flat tax rate of 10% or 20% after considering indexation.
The NSE website provides important information about Sovereign Gold Bonds through frequently asked questions section. SGBs can be traded on stock exchanges from a date notified by the RBI, but only bonds held in de-mat form with depositories are eligible for trading. Additionally, bonds can be sold and transferred according to the provisions of the Government Securities Act, 2006, with partial transfers also being possible.

Investors can place bids for SGBs through either Depository Mode or Physical Mode. In Depository Mode, the RBI credits the Gold Bonds to the client's demat account, while in Physical Mode, the RBI issues a physical Gold Bond Certificate to the clients. Bids can be cancelled until the last date of the issue period.
Although the term of an SGB is eight years, some investors who purchased SGBs earlier may not be able to hold the bonds for the entire tenure. In such cases, these individuals can use exchanges to sell their assets, similar to how stocks are traded.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/sovereign-gold-bonds-how-investors-can-buy-sgbs-from-the-stock-market-step-by-step-guide/articleshow/112830983.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,29.07.2024,"Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24: For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR, which comes with penalties and interest.
What is the penalty for belated ITR filing?

Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.
For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:
Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel.
Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills.
Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,24.05.2024,"Saving Rs 1 crore on a monthly salary of Rs 25,000 may seem daunting, but it is achievable with consistent investments over an extended period. To reach this financial milestone, setting a clear monetary target is crucial. Once the goal of saving Rs 1 crore is established, the next step is to identify the most suitable investment vehicle.
Equity investments have historically delivered higher returns compared to debt instruments.
Although equities are associated with higher risk, they have proven to be rewarding and capable of generating superior returns over the long term, says an ET analysis by Anulekha Ray.
When aiming to accumulate a substantial sum like Rs 1 crore, investing in an equity mutual fund through a systematic investment plan (SIP) is a wise choice, the analysis says.

With a mutual fund SIP, you commit to investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, typically every month. Even if the initial investment amount is modest, the power of compounding and rupee-cost averaging enables you to save a significant lump sum over time.
How To Save Rs 1 crore

While it's not advisable to allocate a significant portion of your income to a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), it's crucial to consistently set aside 15-20% of your salary each month for long-term financial objectives. However, investing a smaller sum means it will require more time to reach your target.

Consider this scenario: if you invest Rs 4,000 per month in an equity mutual fund scheme with an annual return of 12%, it will take you slightly over 28 years (339 months) to accumulate Rs 1 crore, assuming you invest consistently without any interruptions, says the ET analysis.
By increasing your monthly investment to Rs 5,000, you can reduce the time needed to save Rs 1 crore to just over 26 years (317 months) at the same 12% interest rate.
If you can allocate 30% of your salary, which amounts to Rs 7,500 per month, you can achieve your Rs 1 crore goal in 23 years or 276 months, assuming the same annual interest rate.
Furthermore, if you can invest Rs 10,000 every month, which is 40% of your monthly salary, you can reach Rs 1 crore in slightly more than 20 years or 248 months.
These examples demonstrate that the more you can invest each month, the quicker you can attain your financial goal of saving Rs 1 crore.

Based on this calculation, you will achieve your goal of becoming a crorepati in just under 22 years (264 months) if you increase your SIP installment by 10% annually.
Step-up SIP strategy:

Accumulating Rs 1 crore can be achieved more quickly by employing a step-up SIP strategy, which involves increasing your monthly SIP installment annually as your salary rises. This approach not only helps combat the negative impact of inflation on your savings but also enables you to align your savings with your income growth.
By starting with a monthly SIP investment of Rs 4,000 and increasing it by just 5% each year, you can reach your goal of Rs 1 crore in approximately 25 years (301 months). The step-up SIP works by gradually raising your investment amount.
For example, if you begin with Rs 4,000 per month, after a year, you would increase it to Rs 4,200 per month for the entire second year. In the third year, you would invest Rs 4,410 every month, and so on.

The time required to accumulate Rs 1 crore decreases as you increase your initial SIP amount. If you start with Rs 5,000 per month and raise it by 5% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 23 years (281 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% each year, you can become a crorepati in 20.5 years (246 months).
Similarly, starting with a monthly SIP of Rs 7,500 and increasing it by 5% annually, you can save Rs 1 crore in 20.3 years (244 months). A 10% annual increase would allow you to reach your goal in just under 18 years (215 months).
If you begin your SIP investment with Rs 10,000 per month and raise it by 5% each year, you can accumulate Rs 1 crore in 18.3 years (220 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 16 years (194 months).
Remember, even if you can't invest a substantial sum initially, don't worry. Increase your SIP amount only if your salary increases. Consistency and gradual increments can help you reach your financial goals.
SIPs are generally ideal for long-term investments due to the principle of compounding. When investing in a mutual fund SIP, it's important to commit for the long term. Maintaining patience and consistently investing over the years is key. If you can continue your SIP without interruptions, cancellations, or withdrawals during market downturns, you are more likely to achieve your financial goals.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/you-can-become-a-crorepati-even-with-a-monthly-salary-of-rs-25000-heres-how/articleshow/110403142.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,SPEAKING TREE,29.08.2024,"The 20th century marked a significant paradigm shift in scientific thought with the advent of quantum physics. A new era of exploring, understanding and demystifying the subatomic realm was being ushered in.
The laws and principles governing the subatomic world were mired in abstractions, contradictions, and were radically different from the far more predictable domains of classical physics.

Science became much more aware of its limitations. Concepts like superposition, entanglement that initially were restricted to thought experiments were now being verified and even applied commercially.
Quantum computing is one such domain that uses these abstruse characteristics and fundamentals to revolutionise computing. It is now the next big leap that will redefine and reshape the information and technology sector. Conventional computing depends on all data being encoded to a binary code. All data was reduced to variable combinations of 1 and 0. The value of one bit could either be 1 or 0.

Each bit in a byte is assigned a specific value, which is referred to as the place value. Eight bits constitute a byte. A byte's place values are used to determine the meaning of the byte as a whole, based on the individual bits. In other words, the byte values indicate what character is associated with that byte.
What if the bit could simultaneously be 0 and 1? Values lingering in the grey zones of yes and no? A superposition of both possibilities. Welcome to the world of quantum computing.

Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which process information very differently. While classical bits always represent either one or zero, a qubit can be in a superposition of one and zero simultaneously until its state is measured. In addition, the states of multiple qubits can be entangled, meaning that they are linked quantum mechanically to each other. Superposition and entanglement give quantum computers capabilities unknown to classical computing.
Qubits can be made by manipulating atoms, electrically charged atoms called ions, or electrons, or by nanoengineering so-called artificial atoms.
Quantum computers have shown that they can process certain tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. The qualified, time-tested binary system or Dwaitawad used by classical computers is being rendered obsolete by a far more abstract, mystical pleomorphism. The quantum state doesn't negate duality. It rather transcends duality to a state that defies any numerical nomenclature. It could best be termed as a nondual state that is not restricted to but includes duality. A state that has perhaps been the backbone of Indian philosophical systems. Advaita is much more than the mere affirmation of nonduality. It is a state that is all inclusive and omniscient. A quantum superposition that encompasses existence and non-existence and a simultaneity of both states.
The 'either-or' logical binary thought process being replaced by an all-inclusive experiential non-numeric 'And'. A state that alludes to the canvas on which black and white appear as apparitions. The new-age quantum computing might just become the cornerstone of mankind's quest for understanding reality albeit from a quantum perspective. A quantum reality.
A reality that's simultaneously virtual and real.

TOI World Desk,NEWS HOME,02.09.2024,"Kyiv withstood a significant missile assault early Monday morning as Russia launched its third major attack on Ukraine in a week. The barrage, which occurred at the start of the school year, resulted in multiple explosions across Kyiv and other cities.
The attack began around 5:30 am, with an air raid alert lifted an hour later. At least two people were reported injured.
This offensive coincided with ongoing intense battles in eastern Ukraine and followed a Ukrainian drone strike on Russian infrastructure the previous day.
Preliminary reports indicated that the assault involved a combination of Kh-101 missiles launched from Tu-95MS bombers and KN-24/Iskander-M ballistic missiles. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) also participated in the attack.
Kyiv’s military administration reported that air defense forces managed to intercept and destroy over 20 missiles, including both cruise and ballistic types. “We faced a huge number of ballistic missiles simultaneously,” said Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,10.07.2024,"Your CIBIL score plays a critical role in determining whether your credit application gets approved or denied. A high credit score facilitates easier access to credit cards and loans, often at lower interest rates and with additional benefits. Conversely, a low CIBIL score poses significant challenges for individuals seeking urgent credit. Lenders typically reject applications from those with a poor credit score (600 or below), or approve them with higher interest rates.
Improving your CIBIL score requires diligent adherence to specific strategies to enhance creditworthiness.
Improving your credit score takes time and consistent effort. By following these, you can gradually enhance your CIBIL score and improve your chances of accessing credit facilities in the future.
Strategies to boost your CIBIL score

1. Ensure timely repayment of loan EMIs

Paying your loan EMIs on time is crucial for maintaining a good credit score. Missing or delaying payments not only incurs penalties but also negatively impacts your credit score. Consider setting reminders or using Standing Instructions (SI) to automate your EMI payments and avoid any delays.
2. Clear credit card dues promptly
Plan strategically to settle your credit card balances by the due date to avoid negative impacts on your CIBIL score. Non-payment or regular defaults can significantly lower your score. If unable to clear the full amount, at least pay the minimum due to prevent adverse reporting on your
credit report.

3. Review and correct errors in your CIBIL report
Regularly check your CIBIL report for any inaccuracies that could be affecting your credit score. Errors such as incorrect personal information, account details, or overdue amounts can be disputed and corrected online through the CIBIL grievance redressal process, potentially boosting your credit score.
4. Limit multiple credit applications
Avoid making several credit applications within a short period, as each application triggers a hard enquiry on your credit report. Multiple enquiries can signal financial distress to lenders and lower your credit score. Research and apply to only one provider after careful consideration.
5. Consider a secured credit card
If your credit history is impacted by past defaults, consider applying for a secured credit card backed by a fixed deposit. Secured cards can be easier to obtain and using them responsibly by making timely payments can help rebuild your credit score over time.

6. Maintain old credit card accounts
Keep older credit card accounts open, even if you no longer use them actively. Longer credit histories and consistent repayment records can positively influence your creditworthiness and support future credit applications.
7. Monitor co-signed or joint loan accounts
If you've co-signed or guaranteed a loan, monitor its repayment status regularly. Any defaults or delays in payments can affect both the borrower's and co-signer's credit scores. Communicate with the borrower to ensure timely repayments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/debt-management/credit-score-tips-7-ways-to-improve-your-cibil-score/articleshow/111630195.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI,BUSINESS,04.03.2024,"India's journey to superpower status hinges on widespread financial literacy, yet, a stark statistic reveals that only 27% of the population possesses this crucial skill. Lack of financial education renders individuals vulnerable in times of crisis. The government, finance start-ups and other community-led platforms are helping bridge the divide. In line with this objective, The Times Of India has partnered with StockGro to launch the ‘India for Financial Literacy’ campaign.

The aim of this initiative is to equip India and its citizens with knowledge, skills and resources to help them manage their money effectively. Over the course of this campaign, readers can learn about the basics of money management, importance of financial literacy and the role it plays in India’s economic progress from financial luminaries. The campaign launches with a Right To Excellence Financial Literacy Summit to be held in Delhi on Mar 4.
Prasad Sanyal, Business Head, Times Internet said, ""Let’s recognize that financial literacy is not just about understanding numbers; it is about gaining the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions that shape our financial future. By mastering the principles of budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt, we pave the way towards a life of financial independence and stability. Let us commit to educating ourselves and others on the importance of financial literacy, for it is the foundation upon which we build our dreams and aspirations and achieve the excellence we deserve.""
India is often hailed as a future superpower, but the absence of financial education among the masses can make this road long and arduous. This is where the ‘India for Financial Literacy’ campaign can prove to be a game-changer.

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,10.06.2024,"Home Loan Tips: The Reserve Bank of India's decision to maintain policy rates at their current levels has left home loan customers feeling disappointed. As a result, it is unlikely that home loan rates will decrease in the near future. Due to the series of repo rate increases that occurred between May 2022 and March 2023, home loan EMIs have increased significantly, and loan tenures have been prolonged by several years.

If you are considering purchasing a home with a loan, here are five important factors to consider.
1. Shorter Loan Tenure: According to an ET report, experts recommend that borrowers keep their loan tenure as short as possible to minimize the interest burden. The longer the loan tenure, the higher the interest outgo due to the compounding effect. For example, a Rs 50 lakh loan at 9% interest for 10 years will result in a total interest payment of Rs 26 lakh. Extending the tenure to 15 years increases the interest outgo to Rs 41 lakh, and a 20-year loan will result in an interest outgo of Rs 58 lakh.
2. Importance of increasing EMIs: A shorter loan tenure can be challenging for young homebuyers, as the higher EMIs may not fit into their budget. If you must opt for a longer tenure of 15-20 years, try to increase the EMI amount gradually as your income rises. Increasing the EMI by 5% every year can reduce the tenure of a 20-year loan by nearly eight years. If you can manage to increase the EMI by 10% annually, then a Rs 50 lakh home loan with 9% interest rate will be paid off in just 10 years.

Prepayment becomes easier when you anticipate your income to grow each year. It is crucial to remember that prepayment has a more significant impact when the loan is new, so try to increase the EMI as early as possible. Any extra cash, such as proceeds from a maturing investment, a gift, or an annual bonus, should also be used to prepay the loan.

3. Insurance: When considering a home loan, it's crucial to evaluate the insurance options offered by the lender. While it's wise to secure life insurance alongside a substantial loan to protect your dependents from unpaid debt, the policies sold by banks may have limitations. These policies are often linked to the loan and may not be transferable, meaning they will terminate if you switch lenders during the loan tenure. Therefore, it is advisable to buy separate term insurance, as the coverage will continue even if you prepay the loan or change your lender.

4. Link between loan rate and benchmark: Understanding the connection between the benchmark and loan rate is essential when selecting a home loan. Most home loans have floating rates tied to an external benchmark, such as the RBI repo rate, which has remained at 6.5% since June 2023. Lenders determine the reset period, which can be quarterly, half-yearly, or annually. Determine the frequency of the rate reset before taking a loan. Choose a loan that quickly reflects changes in the external benchmark rate.

5. Joint loans: If you have a working spouse, consider taking a joint home loan to maximize tax benefits. The government allows a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh on the interest paid on a home loan. However, with rising home prices, the average loan amount has increased significantly in recent years. At a 9% interest rate, a Rs 50 lakh home loan for 20 years would result in an annual interest of approximately Rs 4.5 lakh.
If your spouse earns as well, you can jointly claim up to Rs 4 lakh in deductions if both husband and wife take a joint home loan and each claims a Rs 2 lakh deduction individually. Additionally, some states offer lower stamp duty rates if the property is registered in a woman's name. For example, in Delhi, the stamp duty is 6% for male buyers, while female buyers pay only 4%.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/debt-management/home-loan-money-saving-tip-how-to-repay-a-rs-50-lakh-home-loan-in-less-than-10-years/articleshow/110871876.cms,,,,,,,,,

However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:
What is gold, silver hallmarking?

Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.
Hallmarking charges

Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.
ALSO READ | Silver set to outperform gold? Precious metal likely to cross Rs 1 lakh mark over 1 year horizon
A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.

Testing for purity

Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.
The importance of hallmarking

The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification (HUID) number.
Old hallmarking signs

If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.
ALSO READ | What is 24 karat gold? Know difference between 999 vs 995 fineness gold
Hallmark symbols

However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.
HUID in the hallmarked gold jewellery

The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.
Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery

Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/what-are-gold-silver-hallmarking-charges-check-details-and-importance/articleshow/110183026.cms,,,,,,,,,

Every job has some level of stress that employees face and Indian companies are no better. According to a joint survey by the job portal Indeed and the Forrester Consulting Group, more than 75 per cent of employees experience low levels of well-being. Added to this stress is the fear that they will be worse off than their parents at the time of retirement.

Financial literacy empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions, build a secure future, and reduce stress. But we learn this very late in life and surprisingly, there is no place for it in the formal education system. By the time employees realise its importance, they are late. This in turn affects their financial decision making and they end up in a worse financial situation. Studies reveal a strong correlation between financial challenges and decreased workforce productivity which ultimately affects the overall productivity of the organisation.
Although employees have individual responsibility, over 67 per cent of employees hold their employers responsible for the creation and maintenance of a safe and happy workplace. Therefore, employers can truly impact their employees' financial well-being by actively promoting financial literacy, given employees spend more than one-third of their day at the workplace. From tax saving tips to choosing between old and new tas regimes, from short- and long-term goal planning to retirement planning, and from daily budgeting to emergency fund management, employees need help in every aspect of their way. They join new companies straight out of college but do not have a proper idea of how to save and invest properly.

In this regard, employers can look at employee financial wellness programmes and take the lead on personal financial education which will better the mental health of the employees leading to organisational growth. Moreover, offering financial wellness programs can be a differentiator for employers seeking to attract and retain top talent in today's competitive landscape. Companies prioritizing their workforce's well-being through financial literacy initiatives become more attractive to potential hires in the job market. Effective financial literacy programs can cultivate a culture of financial wellness within the organization by:
Organizing workshops and seminars: These sessions can cover topics like budgeting, saving for retirement, children's education, managing debt, understanding financial products and services, choosing between new and old tax regimes, providing information about educational websites, informative articles, and financial calculators.
Developing financial wellness environment: Just like ethics and mental health counsellors, companies can have financial health experts like chartered accountants, and certified financial and wealth planners who can offer personalized financial advice are are familiar with budgeting and money management tools.
Considering Incentives: This can include offering incentives for employees who participate in financial literacy programs or complete financial planning workshops which will encourage engagement and proactive steps towards financial well-being.
Conclusion:

Promoting financial literacy among employees is not only a social responsibility, it's also a strategic investment. By equipping their employees with the necessary financial knowledge, organisations can have a more engaged, productive, and healthy workforce. Ultimately, this contributes to building a thriving and sustainable organizational culture. Remember, financially empowered employees are more likely to be empowered in all aspects of their lives, benefiting themselves, their families, and the company they work for.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/the-role-of-employers-in-promoting-financial-literacy-among-employees/articleshow/108258576.cms,,,,,,,,,

TOI Business Desk,BUSINESS,16.08.2024,"Maintaining a minimum balance in your savings bank account is important since many banks charge customers in case they fail to maintain a minimum balance. This requirement ensures that account holders maintain a certain level of funds, which helps cover the cost of account servicing and related operational expenses. Failing to adhere to these requirements often results in penalties.

From the State Bank of India (SBI) to Punjab National Bank (PNB), whether you’re an existing account holder or considering opening a new account, gaining insight into these policies can help you make informed decisions and optimise your banking experience. Here’s an overview of the minimum balance requirements and charges for major Indian banks.
What is the minimum balance for a savings bank account?

The minimum balance requirement varies across banks and savings accounts. It is influenced by the bank’s policies and the free services offered. Banks communicate the required minimum balance to customers, and if the balance falls below this threshold, the bank may levy charges to cover the additional costs of maintaining the account.

What is the average monthly balance (AMB)?
The average monthly balance (AMB) refers to the average amount of money that must be maintained in a savings account to avoid incurring non-maintenance charges. To calculate AMB, banks sum up the closing balances for all days in a month and divide this total by the number of days in the month.
If the AMB falls below the specified requirement, banks typically notify customers within two months, after which a penalty for non-maintenance may be deducted from the account.

Minimum balance requirements and charges for major banks
Here’s a list of the minimum balance requirements and associated charges for some of India’s leading banks, effective as of August 12, 2024 according to an ET report:
State Bank of India (SBI)
SBI does not impose a penalty for non-maintenance of Average Monthly Balance in savings accounts. This policy has been in effect since 2020.

Metro and Urban Areas: Rs 10,000 or a fixed deposit of Rs 1 lakh for a minimum of one year and one day.
Semi-Urban Areas: Rs 5,000 or a fixed deposit of Rs 50,000 for a minimum of one year and one day.
Non-maintenance charges are 6% of the shortfall from the average balance requirement or Rs 600, whichever is lower.
ICICI Bank
ICICI Bank requires a minimum average monthly balance of Rs 5,000. If this requirement is not met, the charges include Rs 100 plus 5% of the shortfall in the required balance.
Punjab National Bank (PNB)
PNB’s minimum balance requirements and charges are:
Rural Areas: Rs 400
Semi-Urban Areas: Rs 500
Urban/Metro Areas: Rs 600
Yes Bank
Yes Bank’s charges for non-maintenance of balance are structured as follows:
If the balance is less than or equal to 100% of the requirement: No charges.
If the balance is more than 50% but less than 100% of the requirement: 5% of the shortfall.
If the balance is 50% or less of the requirement: 10% of the shortfall, with an additional 5% for Savings Value accounts.
The financial impact
Over the past five years, public sector banks have accumulated Rs 8,495 crore from penalties related to non-maintenance of minimum balance requirements. According to an earlier TOI report, the SBI has eliminated these charges, resulting in Punjab National Bank collecting the highest fines, totaling Rs 1,538 crore.
