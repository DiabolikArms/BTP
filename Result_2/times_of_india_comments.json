Time for India to complete the partition by transferring minorities from Pakistan and Bangladesh to India and Muslims from India to Pakistan or Bangladesh. Hindus are suffering in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India are suffering because of MK Gandhi and Nehru Sonia clan. Their heart bleeding for Muslims and no consideration for Hindus. There are reports that Rahul Maino Khan is involved in the regime change in Bangladesh in return for the similar promise for regime change in India to make him PM.",
