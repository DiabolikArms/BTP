In such a perilous situation, a straightforward issue arose: despite significant investments in intelligence infrastructure to crack cases of horrific crimes as quickly as possible, the administration failed to comprehend why top law enforcement agencies have been utterly unable to crack the case. Without a doubt, the instances have shown that the individuals implicated are part of the current administration, which is doing all within its power to shield the offenders. Can the CBI and state law enforcement agencies refute, based on medical reports, that the victim's body was used in a terrible crime of rape and murder with multiple injuries? Therefore, it was unclear why the video if the CT camera at the Media Centre was not working, it also raises a million-dollar question and raises the possibility of a well-thought-out, deliberate criminal plot. The camera has not been examined up to this point. The public is eagerly awaiting the resolution of this case. Additionally, criminals will be tried under harsh parts of the IPC through a fast-track legal process, sending a strong message to other monstrous beings to reconsider their highly vulnerable wilder traits in the face of the law. However, given the importance of politics, the Tai-Tai phish will logically continue, strengthening the bravery of rebel forces to continue breaking the law and carrying out such heinous crimes.",

In such a perilous situation, a straightforward issue arose: despite significant investments in intelligence infrastructure to crack cases of horrific crimes as quickly as possible, the administration failed to comprehend why top law enforcement agencies have been utterly unable to crack the case. Without a doubt, the instances have shown that the individuals implicated are part of the current administration, which is doing all within its power to shield the offenders. Can the CBI and state law enforcement agencies refute, based on medical reports, that the victim's body was used in a terrible crime of rape and murder with multiple injuries? Therefore, it was unclear why the video if the CT camera at the Media Centre was not working, it also raises a million-dollar question and raises the possibility of a well-thought-out, deliberate criminal plot. The camera has not been examined up to this point. The public is eagerly awaiting the resolution of this case. Additionally, criminals will be tried under harsh parts of the IPC through a fast-track legal process, sending a strong message to other monstrous beings to reconsider their highly vulnerable wilder traits in the face of the law. However, given the importance of politics, the Tai-Tai phish will logically continue, strengthening the bravery of rebel forces to continue breaking the law and carrying out such heinous crimes.",

So given this is an unnatural death, who gave permission to the Policy to cremate the body that day? Does the Kolkatta Police has an answer to this? Even if Doctors mght have said Post Mortem done now you can cremate, What made Kolkatta Police trust the RG Kar Doctors where the very Crime was done. Does this need extra intelligence to suspect them also and get Post mortem done in a 2nd Hospital? Please ask Kolkatta Police what explanation they have for this?",

If we had opportunities today, then this poor person would not leave the state and get killed for nothing. More than cow vigilantes (they are just criminals) and Haryana Govt (run by BJPs in disguise of democracy), I will blame Bengal Govt's more than anyone else.

People are sick and tired of Modi.\nThey want me and my vision which is the vision of the future.\nModi's cities are dusty, polluted, dingy, ill designed.\nRecently, he's boasting how he's building 1 subway line in Delhi.\nDelhi is a city of 10 million people. What is one subway line going to do?\nMy cities will have 10 lanes of underground rapid heavy rail. 10 lanes. Think about a 10 lane highway\nthat moves people. This city has subways stops at every residential complex.\nIt is built on transit. Transit is the first thing we plan, along with water, sewers, utilities\nand electricity.\nThis city is moving 2-3 million people per hour through the train system alone. The average commute time\nwill be 15 minutes from your home to place of work.\nThe train drops you to the nearest 3 kilometers. From here, you have three options. You bring a bike seat\nand helmet, then rent an e-bike and take the dedicated bike paths to your work. Or you walk on the cobblestone\npaths which have overhead canopies protecting from rain and sun. They are for pedestrians only and isolated\nfrom all traffic. Or you hail you hail a taxi with your Uber type app and take the taxi.\nThere is no diesel or gas engine allowed. The air quality in this city is the best.\nThe city situated on a massive man made lake that sequesters 400 billion cubic meters of water. You'll never\nhave a problem of not having water like Bangalore or Delhi.\nAll the aparment blocks and flats are on the water's edge. There is a commercial complex downstairs for\ngroceries, doctor, medicines, and amenities. There are about 10,000 people in this apartment block, then\nthere is green space. You're not packed like sardines.\nYou look out of the waterfront, what you will see is greenery because on the other side is all agriculture.\nRice paddies, wheat, oil seed, legumes, etc. You'll see fish farming and aquaculture on the water.\nYou'll see gharial and migratory bird sanctuaries.\nIt's going to be the best. I'm not like the baniya that in the pursuit of profit alone, we have no sense of\nthe quality of life. A sense of citizenship, a sense of community, a sense of investment in the bigger\npicture.\nSomeone like Modi will try to pack people and industry into every square foot. That's why it sucks. That's\nwhy people want to get out of India.\nLuckily you have me. It's not just about the almight dollar. My plan will make the most money of all,\nprecisely because I don't care about money. I care about making the best.",

Waah re !!!\nThe journalist has done this on purpose with an ulterior motive so that impatient readers who donot read till the end will conclude that BJP govt is bad and paint them as a villain. Also the reference of chandrayaan on this was totally unnecessary to sensationalize the entire news. Tell me which country will build a bridge for 7 families. Isn\u2019t it easy to relocate them. Even when govt offered them they have refused. What can govt do ?",

Since the Bridge was for use only by Children of a remote and neglected village to cross only a Stream which could not be crossed by walking across without being washed away, the Bridge had not been inaugurated by the Authorised Inaugurator of India. Therefore, the \u201cBridge\u201d was the round-shaped slippery TRUNK OF A COCONUT TREE which had been felled for the purpose. Since the round shape of the Bridge made foothold difficult, more so when rains had made the Bridge slippery with Moss, Villagers had stretched a thick Jute rope alongside the Bridge to serve as Hand Rail. Since I was not a Fan, I wrote on the Bridge as I have written about this \u201cShip\u201d The Fan Club drowned that Comment and since popularity of the Inaugurator has slipped of late, this Comment would be buried in Disagrees",

May be during his time, the students could go to school in aircraft or ships! Agreed that a bridge is needed for the villagers. But why they kept quiet for eighty years? The Congress party was ruling Maharshtra and India for six decades. Was the media sleeping all along and woke up only after Chandrayan 3?",

GRAND SALUTE and hats off to these kids going to School in such Rafts and risking their necks to avoid a 25 km long route to School BUT a Bridge would surely NOT be a SOLUTION as these Backwaters of the DAM and hence these Students could be relocated to School near to their Place of Residence and report also CLAIMS that their Parents had VOLUNTEERED to stay on in spite of the Plan to relocate them a few years ago. There can be NO sure shot solution to this ISSUE except that these COULD be Lodged in some BOARDING Place and AVOID such commute which is RISKY even during the normal times and using this Thermocol for the Raft is replaced with a good Craft and manned by the OARSMAN with SAFETY for all travelers Hope and Pray that these kids continue to have flair to learn and that these achieve their AIMS in Life ahead and may God Almighty Bless and guide them always",

Far more important projects like Navi Mumbai Railway, Second Thane creek bridge got delayed for the want of funds. There the creek is less than 2 kms. As CENTRAL GOVT refused funding, Maharashtra govt. had to borrow the money and impose toll to pay back the loans. Likewise, Bonds issue has to be floated for the railway project. People have been paying toll or higher ticket fares for ages. Number of people affected / benefited was in millions. Moreover, such projects pay for themselves thru' toll and increased productivity. As regards the bridge on Jayakwadi, govt can't even consider spending several hundred Crores for the convenience of a few people. If the project is to pay for itself, the toll for a single WALK across the bridge would be in Lakhs. Ask NHAI to take it up!",

That energy was cheap, reliable and efficient and kept German products competitively priced to sell in th world market. In a hurry to prove itself the most favourite dog of Papa Biden, Germany misbehaved with Russia and paid the price. It shot its own foot. It is doing the same again by calling Xi a dictator. These people are foolishly buying the American energy at upto 5 times the Russian's price. They have become so spineless and shameless that they cannot even name the biggest beneficiary of the NS I and II sabotage as a suspect!! Pathetic!!!",

Even as I have declared my PAN and at least two were to state govts (flood relief). Third is savings bank account interests. Since my accounts are anyway linked to my PAN (and IT portal) they can even capture that value? May be if they update these too, and get the ITR itself generated from this, auto populated, for me to cross verify and edit.

All our so called legends from the era of Sachin tendulkar onwards (Sehwag,Ganguly etc etc), together cannot show one century in any format world cup finals (all of which we lost), while 4 Australians have hit centuries in World cup finals.

        "comment_text": "As a Vaishnava and a Sri Krishna devotee, I subscribe to the Vedic Indic and Upanishadic view of death. The Bhagavad Gita, in chapter two, gives a well known Vedic Indic description of the soul, or atman, and its transmigration from one body to another one. In Hinduism one finds a three world, three body cosmogony which is very interesting, indeed. The ultimate goal in Hinduism is to achieve moksha, which is liberation from the three worlds and three bodies of transmigration. The soul then is reunited with the ParaBrahman. The soul, or atman, is then fully reintegrated with Nirguna Brahman. NB is conceived of as pure, Unchanging, Undifferentiated Consciousness. He is the sole constitutive reality, and the substratum upon which everything rests. He is eternal and never dies. He is transcendant and immanent. The Hindu saying is: Satyam Jnanam Anantam Brahman. Jai Shree Krishna forever and ever adorable ones!",

Yes, scoring against the hard ball was needed but also was much evident that the batsman who had a start needed to bat deep as starting for new batsman we near impossible. Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma should have endeavored to bat deep. Its becoming very evident that Gill is a \"patta\" wicket batsman if there is swing or spin then he becomes a liability.

How come Indian batters could not score and Indian spinners could not utilise the turning pitches over there.? Excuses cannot be entertained. I observe lack of collective team work here.

Our spinners are no where nearer to Lankans\u2019 and we have to accept. Shreyas is there because he and Gambhir may have signed secret treaties. Shreyas should be scrapped and dumped. I will prefer Pandit than Rahul although his gimmicks of late have not paid off. Seamers are alright at present although board should find replacement of Arshad Sinh at the earliest.",
